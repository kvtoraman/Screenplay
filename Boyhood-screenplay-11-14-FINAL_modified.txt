MOM

Hey, love bug. You ready?






MASON

Yeah. Hey, guess what, Mom?



MOM

What?



MASON

Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss Butler this time. I kinda liked her.



MASON

What did she say?







MOM

Well... she said that you weren't turning in your homework assignments. And I told her, "I know he does them, 'cause I check them every night." She said she found a big chunk of them crumpled up at the bottom of your backpack.



MASON

She didn't ask for 'em.



MOM

Well, baby, she doesn't have to.

You're supposed to turn them in.







MASON

Not all day.



MOM

And she said that you destroyed her pencil sharpener.



MASON

Not on purpose.



MOM

Wait, she said that you crammed a

I thought if it could sharpen pencils, maybe we could sharpen rocks.

MOM

(Reading)



"Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna talk to Moaning Myrtle." "Who?" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. "She haunts one of the toilets in the girls bathroom on the first floor," said Hermione. "She haunts a toilet?"











MOM (CONT'D)

"Yes, it's been out of order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place."



"I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it. It's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you."



INT. BEDROOM - LATER






TED (O.S.)

Why can't you just say that?



MOM (O.S.)

I'm sorry. I don't want to go with you.



TED (O.S.)

You're sorry, that's bullshit!



MOM (O.S.)

That's right, I wanna stay here with my kids. That's what I'd rather do.



TED (O.S.)

All right. Would you stop using

your kids as an excuse?!



MOM (O.S.)

I'm not using my kids as an excuse!






TED (O.S.)

I know you have to stay here with






MOM (O.S.)

You have this immature life--



TED (O.S.)

And why do I always-- Why--



MOM (O.S.)

You have no responsibility.



TED (O.S.)

I have an immature life! I have an immature life?







MOM (O.S.)

And I have responsibilities, okay, you don't know what it's like to be a parent.



TED (O.S.)

No, I don't! And why am I responsible for your mistakes in life?



MOM (O.S.)

If you had any idea. You don't think

wouldn't--



INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT






MOM

Don't call my kids mistakes! Don't!



TED

I'm not responsible for your life choic-- I didn't call your kids--



MOM

You said, "Your respons-- your mistakes in your life," pointing at my kids.



TED

I know what I said, you know what, and immediately you use your kids again.






MOM (O.S.)

This is the reality: I'm a parent!



TED (O.S.)

That's, that's hysterical.



MOM (O.S.)

That means responsibility.



TED (O.S.)

I know you're a parent.



MOM (O.S.)

I would love to have some time to myself! I would love to just go to a fuckin' movie! You don't think I'd like that?











MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Go have some dinner, go to a bar! I don't even know what that's like. I was someone's daughter, then I was somebody's fucking mother! Okay, I don't know what that's like.

"Oops, you think I'm in love. I'm

sent from above. I'm not that







MASON (O.S.)

Stop! Quit it!



SAMANTHA

"You see my problem is this. I'm dreaming away. Wishing that heroes truly exist. I cry watching the day. Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways..."



MASON

Quit! Mom!



SAMANTHA

"But to lose all my senses-- that

What the hell is going on in here?!

MOM

Mason! Do not throw things at your sister!



MASON

She's faking, she hit me first!!

SAMANTHA

No, Mother, we're not moving. Nope, nope, sorry Mom. Nope. Nope.






MOM

Samantha, I have to go back to college so I can make us a better living.






MOM (O.S.) 

With this job I can't take care of us the way I'd like to. I can't keep going this way. And Grandma said she'd help us out... and it would be nice to be near her.



SAMANTHA

Fine, Mother. You can do whatever you want but

(shrugs)

We're not moving.



(Smacks)



Mason moves his fork around in his bowl.







MASON

What about our friends?



MOM

Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write. We can come back to visit. And guess what?

Right?






MOM (CONT'D)

And there's a pool.






INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT






MASON

Mom, do you still love Dad?



MOM

I still love your father... but that doesn't mean it was healthy for us to stay together.



MASON

What if after we move he's trying to find us and he can't?



MOM

Oh, that won't be a problem. He can call Grandma and she'll tell him or he can call Information. We won't be hard to find.






MASON

Is he still in Alaska?

DAD (CONT'D)

There we, there we go, there we go! We got something there! We got something! We got something! Ooooh!






MASON

Last time I went bowling we had bumpers and it was a lot more fun!






DAD

You don't want the bumpers, alright? You bowl a strike with the bumpers and it doesn't mean anything. Trust me. Just lay it out on the lane. One, two, three and...

What's a quarter?



SAMANTHA

You said a-s-s.



DAD

Oh, sorry. My bad.



SAMANTHA

And my teacher says it's a good war, because it's better to be safe than sorry.



DAD

That's what they're teaching you in school? Alright, listen to me. Listen to your father, okay? That is the lie. That's the big lie. Iraq had nothing to do with what happened at the World Trade Center. You know that, right?



SAMANTHA

I guess.







DAD

Alright. Who are you gonna vote for next fall, MJ?



MASON

I don't know.



SAMANTHA

Yeah.



DAD (O.S.)

You ever get mad at your brother?



SAMANTHA

Yeah.



DAD

Yeah. You ever yell at him?



SAMANTHA

Oh yeah.



DAD

Yeah. Doesn't mean you don't love him, right?



SAMANTHA

Mmm...



DAD

Look, the same thing happens when

you're grown up, alright? You...







MASON

What'd you do in Alaska?



DAD

I worked on a boat for a while. Um,






MASON

Did you see any polar bears?

Is this the feather I sent you?



MASON

Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.







SAMAMTHA

It's a totem. Wow.

MASON

Yeah, and we got to ride around in






MOM (O.S.)

Wow.



DAD

Hey, Liv.



MOM

Hey.



DAD

I know you wanted me to drop them off at your mom's. I just thought it'd be easier if I brought 'em over here.



MOM

Well, it really screwed up my plans.



MASON

Well, we just wanted to show him our rooms.



SAMANTHA

EXT. COLLEGE - DAY






INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY






BILL (V.O.)

Okay. An unconditioned stimulus, something that produces an unlearned, involuntary, unconditioned response.









BILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus, that he used? Come on now, people! Tough weekend? What's the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat. Meat powder, actually. Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog. Okay. He put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was? Salivation. Alright. Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus-response pair that happens to you everyday. It's probably happening to some of you right now.

(pause)



How about sex? Sure, you know. You see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response. You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about... Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog.






BILL (CONT'D)

Thank you very much. Class dismissed.






MOM (O.S.)

Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason.



BILL

Ohh.



MOM

Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock.



BILL

Your son. Now see, I thought this was a boy genius who was taking my college course.






MOM

He wasn't feeling well today, so I thought I'd bring him with me.










BILL

Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I can tell because I have a nine year old son, he pulls this all the time. Same kind of deal. Hey, you play soccer?



MASON

Mm, no.



BILL

Neither does my boy. He hates soccer. He likes computers. My 11-year-old daughter, loves soccer. Who can figure? Hey, maybe we can get all you guys together sometime, huh?



MOM

Maybe, yeah. Well, you ready to go?



MASON

Yeah.



BILL

Nice to meet you, Mason.



MASON

Nice to meet you, too.



BILL

And thanks for coming to my class.






BILL (CONT'D)

Olivia.



MOM

Hm?



BILL

Nice kid.

Thanks.

So you think, uh, Grandma might be available for a little baby-sitting?

Maybe.

Really? Well, great.

BILL

Yes, we did.






MINDY

Hey, Mom, can we see your wedding



ring?



MOM (O.S.)

Oh, sure.






MINDY (O.S.)

(Eyeing the ring)



Wow.



SAMANTHA (O.S.)

(Holding the ring)



Technically that's a fancy step cut surrounded by miniature brilliant.



MASON

I wish we could've gone to Europe.



RANDY

Yeah.



BILL

Yeah, we'll go as a family next time.













MASON

Really?



BILL

And the hotels are really small and really old. Squeaky.






WAITER

Can I get you anything else? Would you like to see a dessert menu?



BILL

(To Randy)

than going camping with your brother



and your father who love you?



SAMANTHA

Yes. Sorry.



DAD

Wow. Is there gonna be alcohol there?



SAMANTHA

Probably not. Maybe some of the

seniors.







DAD

Mm-hmm. I know what this party is.

The parents are out of town, right?

SAMANTHA

No.

Is he your boyfriend?

Kind of.






DAD

Have you met him? Has he been around the house?



MASON

Sometimes.



DAD

Sometime-zz? Zzz?






DAD (CONT'D)

You have a boyfriend... Wow. Have you heard of Sarah Palin?



SAMANTHA

Yes.



DAD

What's the one thing that you know about Sarah Palin's seventeen year old daughter?



SAMANTHA

She's pregnant?



DAD

That's right. And what is the one thing that you are not going to be in a couple of years when you turn seventeen?



SAMANTHA

Pregnant?



DAD

That's right! Alright, now what are the, the two ways that you can achieve that goal? The first is... not have any sex. Okay? That's the first way. Okay? Just not engage in that. That did not work out very well for your mother and me. And what's the second way?






DAD (CONT'D)

Where are you going?







MASON

Bathroom.



DAD

You don't have to go to the bathroom. Sit down, Mason. Just... Just sit down. What's the second way? Alright? Has your mother talked to you guys about this stuff?



SAMANTHA

Oh, Dad. Dad.



DAD

No, come on. Has she talked to you about... contraception?



The kids are visibly uncomfortable with the conversation. DAD  (CONT'D)



Huh? What has she -- condoms? Has she talked about that?



SAMANTHA (O.S.)

Oh, Dad. Please!



DAD

What? What?



SAMANTHA

That's enough.



DAD

Well. Does Garret have a condom?



SAMANTHA

Ohh! God! Dad!



DAD

What? What, come on Sam. We have to be able to talk about this. Alright? Come on, we do. We can do it. We can do it. Just stay with me here. Alright? It's as hard for me as it is for you. But, seriously though, alright, I read an article in the paper the other day... that said that although U.S. teenagers are not the most sexually active, we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancy. Okay?










TAMMY

We, the men, are going camping.

Boys are going camping. Alright, very nice. Well uh, we still on for tomorrow or...?

TAMMY

Okay. Great. It was really nice

meeting you both. Take care.



DAD

I'll see you.



TAMMY

Talk to you soon. Bye.






DAD

Don't -- don't, don't look at me like that, alright? I just -- look, just to finish the point -- okay? I was twenty-three when your mom had you, alright? So was she, alright? And we didn't put ourselves in the best position to be great parents, and I wish that -- I wish I were a better parent to you guys. Alright? And I, I hope that you can learn from my mistakes. Okay? So, wear a condom. Or get Garrett to -- I don't know. Whatever.

All over.



DAD

All over Texas?



MASON

Yeah.



DAD

Well, if you gotta move, you gotta move, you know? It's no big deal. We can handle that. I'll still come get you every other weekend. I mean, unless she moves 500 miles away or something, it'll just be a little more car time. No big deal.



MASON

I'm just kinda sick of moving.



DAD

Well, I bet you are. But you know, you never know. I mean, I might have to move, right? I'm working for this insurance company now. These places get bought and sold all the time. You know? We'll just roll with it.






MASON

I thought you were a musician?

MASON

Well, we talked on the phone.



DAD

Oh yeah? How'd that go?



MASON

Pretty terrible.



DAD

Oh yeah?











DAD (CONT'D)

(Laughs)



Why?



MASON

Well, when we're at school, we got plenty to talk about, but when we're alone or on the phone, it's like we have nothing in common.



DAD

Nothing?



MASON

Uh, she's not interested in music or video games or... the three best movies this summer...



DAD

All right. What?

Tropic Thunder, Dark Knight and

She said they all sucked.

I don't know. Goin' to the mall

with her stupid friends.



DAD

Alright. Well, is she cute? Watch your step there.



MASON

Yeah.



DAD

Yeah? Alright. Well, here's what you do. Alright. First off, you gotta ask her a lot of questions. Then you have to listen to the answers, alright, actually be interested in her. Alright, if you can do those things, you're gonna be light years ahead of all the other guys.

MASON

That's like advertisement worthy.



DAD

Mm-hm. Advertisement quality.



MASON

Yeah.






DAD

You think they ever will make another "Star Wars"?



MASON

I don't know. I mean, I think if they were to make another one that the period where the game is set is where it would have to be, 'cause there's nothin' after, really. At the end --



DAD

Yeah, no, "Return of the Jedi" it's over. There's nothin' --







MASON

Yeah, there's nothing else to do

You know, you can turn Han Solo into a Sith lord. I mean --

Hi Jill.

So, where are you going?

Over to the college.



JILL

What's going on there?



MASON

My mom's a teacher.



JILL

Oh, cool! What does she teach?



MASON

Psychology... I think. What are you up to?



JILL

Oh, my mom owns Needleworks.











JILL (CONT'D)

The arts and crafts store over there?






MASON

How come?



JILL

You know Courtney? Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring? Wears Hot Topic every day?



MASON

I... think so.



JILL

We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kinda grown apart. She sorta got all emo. She thinks I'm a prep. But, I still consider her a friend! Anyway, she cut one of her wrists. I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit.






JILL (CONT'D)

So what are you reading?



MASON

Oh, it's uh, "Breakfast of Champions".






JILL

I think my older brother likes him. I'm reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the third time. My friends make fun of me. I think I'm the only girl in the whole school who doesn't like the "Twilight" books. Have you read them?



MASON

Sure haven't.



JILL

I tried... but it was so cheesy! So how do you like San Marcos?



MASON

I like it alright. It's a lot smaller than Houston, but it seems pretty cool. Have you always lived here?







JILL

Yeah. If you want the big city around here, you have to drive to San Antonio or Austin. Have you been there yet?



MASON

I went to San Antonio for a day, but... I haven't been to Austin yet.



JILL

That's where all the high school kids go, on weekends, for shows and stuff.



MASON

That's what I've heard.



JILL

So are you going to Shauna's party next weekend?



MASON

Um... I think I heard about it. I'm not really sure, though.



JILL

Well you should!



MASON

Why's that?



JILL

Well -- LeeAnn has a big crush on

you and I know she was hoping you




girlfriend, do you?



MASON

Not currently.



JILL

Well then, you should come. I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.



MASON

Okay.



JILL

But don't tell LeeAnn I told you






MASON

I won't.







JILL

Well, I better get going. See you later.



MASON

Bye.



INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY






MOM (O.S.)

His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!" Or... "Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!"






MOM (CONT'D)

So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment -- oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I -- some of you might have classes with Elena -- she and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by.

MOM

Thanks.






MOM (CONT'D)

Samantha!






SAMANTHA

Okay! Mom...



MOM

Why in the hell didn't you pick up your brother like you said you would?



SAMANTHA

Mom, I know what you're gonna say. She was running late and we couldn't turn around.



MOM

No, no! No excuses! The bottom line is you didn't do what you said you were gonna do. You stranded your brother!



SAMANTHA

It's embarrassing to ask my friend to turn around and go get some kid at the middle school.



MOM

What do you mean "some kid"? He's your brother! And you know what? We've helped Janie out before. I mean, she lives right around the corner. It's no big deal.



SAMANTHA

Sorry.



MOM

You know what, Samantha? You need to start thinking long and hard about who you want to be.











MOM (CONT'D)

Do you want to be a cooperative person, who is compassionate and helps people out? Or do you want to be a self-centered narcissist?



SAMANTHA

You know what? You're right. I am this horrible person... But honestly, he's not a baby anymore. You don't have to treat him like one. He's in eighth grade and he can find his way home if he wants to.



MOM

You know what? When Gaby leaves,

you and me are gonna have a chat.






SAMANTHA

Awkward...

Dude, that sucks.

Nice.

Aw, no thanks.

Come on, man.

What, are you a pussy?



TONY

No, I just don't feel like drinking a beer right now.



CHARLIE

Man, if you're too chicken shit to even have a beer, I know for a fact that you have never gotten any pussy.



TONY

Like you guys have.



CHASE

Sure have.



TONY

When?



CHASE

Last summer.



MASON

With who?



CHARLIE

It was awesome. Chase went down easy street and fucked this whore Nancy. At least that's what he said.



CHASE

I did. Would I lie?



SENIOR GUY

Bullshit. Quick, where were you?



CHASE

At Tobler's house. And, she fucked a couple other guys, too.







CHARLIE

Oh man, his first piece of ass was sloppy seconds.






CHARLIE (CONT'D)

What about you, Mason? You ever got any?



SENIOR GUY

Yeah, you ever made her, uh, howl



into the night?



MASON

A few times.



TONY

(skeptical)



Really?



SENIOR GUY

Yeah, right. What was her name,

Lucky?



MASON

Nooo. Jennifer. She doesn't live here, though. She's back in Houston.



CHARLIE

You're fucking lying.



MASON

I don't care if you assholes believe me or not.



SENIOR GUY

Let me guess -- you were pulling all kinds of ass back home, but once you got down here... lefty.






MASON

Hey, fuck you. I would, but none of the girls here want to.



CHARLIE

Dude, it's not what they want, man.






SENIOR GUY

True dat.










CHARLIE

You know what you should do? Join a band. That's all it takes, man.



MASON

Oh yeah?



CHARLIE

Fuck yeah, dude. You don't even have to play that well. I mean, you start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blow jobs.

(Points to Tony)

Except for you. It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.



TONY

I'm not in the fucking marching band.



SENIOR GUY

Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute.



TONY

Alright, I got a question for you guys. If you think you're so cool, why are you hanging out with a bunch of eighth graders on a Friday night?



SENIOR GUY

Hey, fuck you, you little penis wrinkle. You know, you're lucky to even be here. This is our camp out. The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother, and then he drags along you little dice danglers. Fucking fuzz nut, talking shit!

It's all good, man. These little

fuzz nuts are going to get their





CHASE

Alright.

Alright, good man. What about you,

Peter Puffer?



TONY

I don't know. Maybe.



SENIOR GUY

Dude, it's okay to be gay. We understand. Just, you know, sleep over there.



TONY

I'm not gay.



CHARLIE

Give it some time, man. You'll

realize.



TONY

Fuck y'all.

See, that's exactly my point, man. Nah, but we don't have whores coming over, we were just fucking with you to see what you'd say.

MASON

Not very long. Um, I went to this camp thing just this past summer.



COLLEGE GIRL

They have a camp for graffiti?



MASON

Well, they call it "urban art".



COLLEGE GIRL

Oh.



MASON

So it sounds, you know, less illegal, but... it was really just a way to get free spray paint.



COLLEGE GIRL

Cool. So is this your tag? Is that -- do they still call it...?



MASON

Yeah, but you know, it's just letters that I'm good at writing.



COLLEGE GIRL

Oh. K...

INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER






JIM

...So anyway, we figured out a way to rig up our iPods to the external speakers on the ASV. So every time we come rolling into town, you knew the 456 was there, 'cause we were bumping House of Pain. It was like, "Jump around, Jump around." And the whole family's coming outside, and you got the kids and the mom and the dad, and they're all bouncing up and down. We're throwing out candies for the kids, and soccer balls, and Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um, like, smokes for the adults. And they loved, they absolutely loved, Gatorade. But for some reason, you know, they hated the lemon-lime flavor. I don't know what it was. Yeah. Couldn't give it away.










MOM

How long were you over there?



JIM

Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and one in Bosnia.



MOM

Wow.



MASON

Did you enlist?



JIM

Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army

National Guard. And, uh, you know














MOM

But is that odd? Is that unusual?



JIM

Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the guys that came along after us and replaced us, they didn't listen to any of our advice. They, you know, did basically the polar opposite of what we did, and they lost seven guys in the first month.



MOM

Wow. What did you guys do

differently?



JIM

Well, I'd like to think it's just a matter of mutual respect, you know. I mean, all the time we spent over there building trust, I mean these guys basically destroyed it in three days.

Uh, just now, I guess.



PROFESSOR DOUGLAS

Yeah, how old are you?







MASON

Fifteen.



PROFESSOR DOUGLAS

Fifteen! Give me a hug.






PROFESSOR DOUGLAS (CONT'D)

Happy birthday. Oh my goodness!






MOM

(to Mason)



Have you been drinking?



MASON

Have you?



MOM

Yeah, a little. Have you?



MASON

A little bit.



MOM

Have you been...?






MASON

A little bit.



MOM

Oh... okay.



MASON

I'm gonna go to sleep.



MOM

Talk in the morning, huh?



EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - DAY






SAMANTHA

Hey, Dad!



DAD

Hey! How you doing?










SAMANTHA

Good! Whose car is that?



DAD

That's our car. Hop on in there.



SAMANTHA

(to Annie)



Hey!



ANNIE

Hey, sweetie.






SAMANTHA

Hey Cooper! Hey, how's it goin'?

Hello little brother!

(to Annie)



He's so cute.



EXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS






MOM

Can we just replace that part of the pipe?



WORKER

No, no it's no good. Everything is no good.



MOM

(attempting Spanish)



Todo... Total?



WORKER

Everything, yes... Mira.






WORKER (CONT'D)

See this one is...



MOM

Gusto... it's stronger?



WORKER

Yes. It's better. Yes, yes, yes.







EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS



DAD

(to Jim)



Hey listen, uh, thanks for that camera you got Mason.



JIM

Oh, yeah... Mason's --



DAD

He's loving that thing.



JIM

He's all into the photography thing right now.



DAD

Yeah, I know.



JIM

He's actually talking about turning his, uh, his closet into a dark room. The red light and developing, the whole nine...



DAD

Yeah? You alright with that?



JIM

I probably won't see him for a week...



DAD

Yeah... Right... Well...



JIM

But, you know. He's having a good time.



DAD

At least he's focusing on something.



JIM

Yeah, yeah.



DAD

You know? That's what I like.



JIM

Yeah, he's all about it.







EXT. JIM'S SIDE YARD - CONTINUOUS



MOM

(pointing to the pipe)



Okay... Let's go grande.



WORKER

It's good?



MOM

It's good.



WORKER

It's good. It's better. Yes.






MOM

Hey, you know, you're smart. You

should be in school.



WORKER

I like school, I need school, but






MOM

Go to night school. At community

college. It's -- It's pretty




EXT. JIM'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS



DAD

You're doing a nice job with the house though, it's looking great... really great.



JIM

Thanks. Yeah, you know, some fix-its here and there, you know. We got a good deal on the foreclosure... So, now I'm finding out why. You



know?



DAD

(laughs)



Yeah. Right?






DAD (CONT'D)

Hey bud! Hey, Happy Birthday!










MASON

What's that?



DAD

What's that? That's our new car!

Get in it.






JIM

Alright, have a good weekend.






MOM

Hi.



DAD

Hey, how you doing? Good to see

you.



MOM

You too.

(to Annie)



Hey!



ANNIE

Hey, how are you?






MOM

You look great.



ANNIE

Oh, thanks.



MOM

Aww, look at him! Ooh. He's got

Mason's nose.



SAMANTHA

Yeah, isn't he cute?



MOM

Yeah.






DAD

Alright!



MASON

Love you guys.







DAD

We got a big drive ahead of us.



MOM

Bye, Sam.



JIM

You guys drive safe.



DAD

Alright. Well, we'll be back tomorrow night.



MOM

Bye, honey. I'm so glad you were

born!






INT. MINI-VAN - DAY



MASON

So, this is like Annie's car and... and you drive the GTO? I guess you can't really put a baby seat in that thing.



DAD

Yeah, no... But I had to sell that anyway.



MASON

You what?



DAD

Yeah, I had to sell that.



MASON

So... so it's gone?



DAD

Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there.











DAD (CONT'D)

But... if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, you know, the value starts going up again. I mean shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra.



After a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quiet. DAD (CONT'D)



What?



MASON

You don't remember?



DAD

Remember what?



MASON

Really? You said that was going to be my car when I turned sixteen.



DAD

(laughs)



What? No, I didn't. I never said that.



MASON

I remember. I was in third grade

and you were taking me over to Anthony Nagar's house for his birthday...




DAD

What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never.



MASON

Yeah. You did though.



DAD

What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?











DAD (CONT'D)

(laughs)



Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean, you're not... Ughh.










ANNIE

Does your mom actually let you watch this?



SAMANTHA

Yeah. She likes it too.



ANNIE

(laughing)



Oh, my god... Okay, well.



SAMANTHA

Yeah.



ANNIE

Have you ever seen her in concert?



SAMANTHA

No. But she's coming to Houston in

April.



ANNIE

She's coming to Houston?



SAMANTHA

Mm-hmm.



ANNIE

Oh you know, your dad and I could get you tickets, and you could stay with us.



SAMANTHA

That'd be great.







ANNIE

Yeah.



DAD

Hey, hey, Annie? Will you get me the, the little birthday present for Mason?



ANNIE

Yeah, babe.






DAD

Alright. This one, this one needs a little explanation, okay? Open it up. I call that "The Beatles' Black Album". Alright, what it is, is the best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo solo, post-break up.



MASON

Thanks.



DAD

Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you.






DAD (CONT'D)

You know, whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know? But you put 'em next to each other, alright, and they start to elevate each other... and then you can hear it. Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?



MASON

I don't know. I think I always just liked Paul the best.



DAD

It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. Alright?











DAD (CONT'D)

And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father.



ANNIE

Very arranged and very organized, over and over again by your loving father.



DAD

Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks... You've got "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into "Photograph". I mean, come on.






MASON

Cool.



EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY






DAD

Hey there, Cliff.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Hey, how you doin'?



DAD

Oh, good. How you doin'?



NANA

(to Mason)



Oh, hi, birthday boy! It's good to see you.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Good. Good to see you.



DAD

Ah, it's great to see you.

Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Mason... Happy birthday to you!



DAD

Make a wish, make a wish.










NANA

Real good! Presents! Wait, wait, wait. Here, sweetie.






DAD

Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright.






NANA

I hope you like it. I heard you

didn't have one, so.






NANA (CONT'D)

It's a Bible. Is this your first

Bible? Look, there's your name...



MASON

Wow.



NANA

...In gold. And wait-wait-wait-wait. Look at this. It's a Red Letter edition, and that means that everything Jesus said is in red.



MASON

Thank you.



NANA

Like it? Alright. I love you,

sweetie. Happy Birthday.



ANNIE

And this one's from us.






DAD

It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's...






DAD (CONT'D)

It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this.







NANA

Wow!



DAD

You've got life ahead of you. You know --



ANNIE

And the shirt is blue, and I know






DAD

You've got dances --



NANA

It's beautiful!



DAD

And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here.






GRANDPA CLIFF

Mason?



DAD

(whispers)



The Black Album was from me.



NANA

Uh-oh.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Come here, son. Pull that off.






GRANDPA CLIFF (CONT'D)

There's a 20 gauge shotgun.



MASON

Wow.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Yeah. My dad gave it to me when I was a little younger than you, and his dad gave it to him, and well, you're fifteen and I'd like for you to have it. Alright? Here, you hold it. Yeah.



MASON

(taking the gun)



Thank you.







GRANDPA CLIFF

Congratulations, son. I'll teach

you how to clean it, teach you how








EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY






DAD

Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here --



SAMANTHA

Mm-hm.



DAD

Now which one you aiming at?



SAMANTHA

Ah, the middle can.



DAD

The middle can? Alright, alright.

Now fire at will, alright?



SAMANTHA

Okay.






DAD

Ho. Whoa!






SAMANTHA

Yeah!



GRANDPA CLIFF

Howdy!



DAD

Alright, watch out, watch out. Whoa.














GRANDPA CLIFF

Ready? Pull!






GRANDPA CLIFF 

You uh, you uh, hit a little low. Wait until it gets up high and then shoot. Alright? Cause then it's a better aim coming down. Remember, second trigger.



MASON

Mm-hm.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Ready?



MASON

Mm-hm.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Pull!







GRANDPA CLIFF 

Hah! Hah! Look what you did! Well, you nailed it, didn't you? How's that feel?



MASON

Felt good.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Yeah, it felt good. Good.



EXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT






DAD

(singing)



Well, I want for us to be together forever.



ANNIE

(singing)



But to wander wherever I may.







DAD

(singing)



I want you to be easy and casual.



ANNIE

(singing)



But still demand I stay.



SAMANTHA

(singing)



I want for you to know me completely, but still remain mysterious.



MASON

(singing)



Consider everything deeply, but still remain fearless.



DAD AND ANNIE

(singing)



Climb to the top, look over the ledge. Dance barefoot on a razor's edge. Reach for the stars, grab the tiger by the tail.



MASON

(singing)



If I don't try, I'll never fail.



DAD

Good!



DAD AND ANNIE

(singing)



If you go home, you're rolling the dice. Can't step in the same river twice. If you love too much it'll turn to hate. If you never leave home you'll never be late. If you eat too much, you're gonna get fat. If you buy a dog, you'll piss off your cat.






DAD AND ANNIE 

Take a deep breath, and enjoy the ride. Cause arrivals and departures run side by side...










DAD (O.S.)

Alright, you're our first audience, you know? Mason demanded we work on it the whole drive.



GRANDPA CLIFF

It was really wonderful. That's

sweet. Sweet.



NANA

Thank you, thank you, thank you.



GRANDPA CLIFF

Impressive.



DAD

It's a work in progress.



EXT. CHURCH - DAY






PREACHER (O.S.)

A week later -- we don't know why Thomas wasn't there the first time -- but a week later, Thomas comes back and joins the other disciples. They say, "Hey, the Lord's alive, we saw him!"



INT. CHURCH - DAY






PREACHER

"I won't believe it until I put my finger into his side and I'm gonna see those nail prints in his hands." Poof! About that time, here comes Jesus, standing right next to him. Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't you know Thomas felt some shame?









PREACHER (CONT'D)

And Jesus said, "Well, that's good.











PREACHER (CONT'D)

But blessed are those who can believe without seeing." It's a lot easier when you can see, and feel, and touch. But like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh. We haven't felt him in the flesh. But we have experienced him in the spirit. At least I have, and I hope y'all have too.



EXT. WOODS - DAY






ANNIE

The pond's right up here. Ooh, it's low.



DAD

Yeah.



ANNIE

You know, my dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want.



MASON

Nice.



ANNIE

(to Cooper)



Hi, baby. What's goin' on?






ANNIE (CONT'D)

You know, I think we're just gonna hang out here for a minute.



DAD

Want me to stay with you?



ANNIE

No, it's okay.



DAD

You sure?



ANNIE

Yeah, thanks.










SAMANTHA

Mason, why are you such a stick-in-the-mud?



MASON

What are you even talking about?



DAD

Hey, you guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?



MASON

No, it's fine.



DAD

Sam?



SAMANTHA

Okay.



DAD

I appreciate it. It means a lot to

Annie and her folks, you know.



MASON

Were we baptized?






DAD

I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul. We can do it now, though, if you want.



MASON

No, nah, I think I'm alright.



DAD

You and Cooper together, you know.






SAMANTHA

You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?



DAD

And what's that supposed to mean,



hm?



ANNIE

I can hear you!







DAD

Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh. I don't think your mom would love that.






DAD (CONT'D)

Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you how it's done.






SAMANTHA

Nice, Dad.






DAD

Still got the goods, hmm?



INT. DARKROOM - DAY






TURLINGTON

How long you been in here, Mason?



MASON

I'm not sure.



TURLINGTON

I'm sure. All class. Did you

complete your image diary?



MASON

Not yet.



TURLINGTON

Completed your, uh, digital contact sheet?



MASON

Not quite, but... I mean, it's not gonna take me long.



TURLINGTON

Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time is extra-curricular. I mean technically, you don't ever have to be in here these days, and certainly not until you've completed your assignments. That's the deal.







MASON

Sorry.



TURLINGTON

I'm worried about you, Mason.



MASON

Why is that?



TURLINGTON

I'll tell you why. The images you're turning in, they're cool. You're looking at things in a really unique way. Got a lot of natural talent.



MASON

Thanks.



TURLINGTON

Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will just get you a cup of coffee in this old world. I've met a lot of talented people over the years. How many of them made it professionally without discipline, commitment, and a really good work ethic?



Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure. TURLINGTON (CONT'D)



I can tell you. I can count it on two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna happen for you, Mason. The world is too competitive. There are too many talented people who are willing to work hard. And a butt-load of morons who are untalented, who are more than willing to surpass you. As a matter of fact, a lot of them are sitting in that classroom out there right now. Hm? You know what they're doing? They're doing their assignments, which is what you're supposed to be doing, but you're not. You're in here. Why is that? Are you special, Mason?



MASON

No, but I mean the things you're talking about, like work ethic or whatever, I feel like I do work pretty hard. I spend the whole weekend taking pictures a lot of times.







TURLINGTON

You like football, Mason?



MASON

Not really.



TURLINGTON

Yeah, I know you don't. That's why I've just assigned you to shoot the football game tonight. Okay? It starts at 7:30. I want you to get there early. I want you to shoot a full card, three hundred images, and I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em sorted, and I want to see them very first thing Monday. Okay? You want to know why I'm doing this?



MASON

I guess.



TURLINGTON

Who do you want to be, Mason? What do you want to do?



MASON

I want to take pictures. Make art.



TURLINGTON

Any dip-shit can take pictures, Mason. Art, that's special. What can you bring to it that nobody else can?



MASON

That's what I'm trying to find out.



TURLINGTON

Try harder. Hey, maybe in twenty years you can call old Mr. Turlington and you can say, "Thank you, sir, for that terrific dark room chat we had that day."

(walking away)

Get back to class and do your work.



INT. CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER






NICK

Hey man. You're walkin' a little

funny.







MASON

Fuck you.



NICK

I'm just saying, you guys were in there for a long time. Just hope he bought you dinner first.






INT. JIM'S HOUSE - DAY






MOM

Mason! Honey, come down for dinner.






MOM (CONT'D)

Samantha! You didn't post these pictures and their descriptions? Come on, this auction is going to end on Sunday, honey. You've got to get those posted.



SAMANTHA

Why are we even doing this? It's like an online junk shop. I thought you had a good job?



MOM

I do. We're what you call house poor. Everyone's got to do their part. Your brother took the pictures. You have to help.



SAMANTHA

Who even buys this shit?



JIM

Hey, Sam, watch your mouth, alright? Don't disrespect your mother. You like a roof over your head, don't you?



MOM

Yeah, and you like having electricity so that you can charge your cell phone?







SAMANTHA

I'm not even gonna be here next year. I'm a senior. I should be having fun.






JIM

Nice nails.



MASON

Yeah, some girl did that in sixth






JIM

You planning on keeping them?



MASON

Until it comes off, I guess.



JIM

Last summer it was the earrings, and now the nails. You got a, uh, you got a purse to go with all that?



SAMANTHA

A lot of guys do that. He's just

trying to be cool.



JIM

When I was in high school, having a job, being responsible, being able to afford a car, that was cool.



MOM

Mason, honey, why don't you get you and your sister some water.






EXT. FOOTBALL GAME - NIGHT






NICK

Hey man, Turlington says to cut the artsy crap and shoot the game. So take your lens and point it that way.







MASON

Jesus Christ.



NICK

Also, we got a ride tonight.



CHASE

McCormick gonna take us to the party.

We're gonna head out after the game.



You're goin', okay?



MASON

Okay.



NICK

Shoot the game.






EXT. PARTY - NIGHT






BEER PONG GUY

Kobe...






GABY

Oh! First one. What was that?

What was that? What is up?







SHEENA

Hey, what's up?



MASON

Hey. How's it goin'?



SHEENA

Pretty good. How long have you been here?



MASON

I don't know. Awhile, I guess.



SHEENA

Awhile? Yeah.







EXT. QUIET SPOT - MOMENTS LATER






MASON

I just feel like there are so many things that I could be doing and probably want to be doing that I'm just not.



SHEENA

Why aren't you?



MASON

I mean, I guess it's... just being afraid of what people would think. You know, judgment.



SHEENA

Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but, everyone does, you know? Deep down.



MASON

Exactly. I find myself so furious at all these people that I'm in contact with just for controlling me or whatever, but you know, they're not even aware they're doing it.



SHEENA

Yeah. So... in this perfect world where no one's controlling you, what's different? What changes?



MASON

Everything. I mean, I just wanna be able to do anything I want, because it makes me feel alive. As opposed to giving me the appearance of normality.



SHEENA

Whatever that means.



MASON

I don't think it means much.



SHEENA

You're kinda weird, you know that?



MASON

Yeah?











MASON (CONT'D)

(Laughing)



Is that a compliment?



SHEENA

I don't know. Do you wanna be weird?



MASON

I mean, I don't want to like... scare kids at the park, or anything like that.






MASON (CONT'D)

I really like talking with you. I don't usually even try to like vocalize my thoughts or feelings or anything. Just, I don't know, it just never sounds right. Words are stupid.



SHEENA

So, why're you trying with me?



MASON

I don't know. I guess I feel

comfortable.



SHEENA

I'm glad.



EXT. JIM'S HOUSE - LATER






MASON

Hey, Jim. I'm sorry I'm so late.



JIM

What time were you supposed to be



home?



MASON

I don't know. Awhile ago.



JIM

Awhile ago like, thirty minutes ago, an hour ago? Cause, truthfully, nobody even knew where you were until your sister told us. She's been home for awhile.







MASON

I'm sorry.



JIM

Yeah, been hearin' a lot of that lately. See, but you don't actually care. You just kinda... kinda come and go as you please and you don't care if your mom's upset or what time you gotta be home... Is that what's up?



MASON

I don't know what to tell you.



JIM

Stop mumbling! You know, speak up! I can't understand a word comin' outta your mouth. It's just like, "uh uhh nuhh" and I ask you questions and you just--



MASON

Man, can I just have one day where everyone isn't all over my ass!?






JIM

I'm up your ass? This is my house. Now, if you wanna live in my house then you get home when you say you're gonna be home.



MASON

You know, Jim, you're not my dad.



JIM

No, I'm not your dad! You know how I know that? Cause I'm actually here. I'm the guy with the job, paying the bills, taking care of you, your mom, your sister... Huh?! Huh?!






JIM (CONT'D)

I'm that guy...










INT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY







MASON

Morning.



MOM

Morning. Hey, which one of you guys used the downstairs bathroom last night?



MASON

I don't know. I didn't.



MOM

That tall guy, what's his name?



MASON

Phillip?



MOM

Yeah, Phillip. He did it. Can Phillip read? I mean, there's a big sign on the door, it says, "Do not use this bathroom, it's broken." I mean, how difficult is that?



MASON

I don't know. I'm sorry.






MOM

I think I'm gonna put the house on the market.



MASON

Why?



MOM

This house is too big for us. I

mean, you're going to school







MASON

Well why did you even buy it in the first place, then?



MOM

Because I really enjoy making poor life decisions, keeping us on the









MOM (CONT'D)

brink of poverty. I mean, I've spent the first half of my life acquiring all this crap and now I'm gonna spend the second half of my life getting rid of all this stuff.



MASON

Really? Like what?



MOM

Like - Well, I got rid of a couple

husbands, now I'm gonna get rid of a




plumbing... Ahhh. You know what?





MASON

Don't be gross, Mom.



MOM

Fine. I'll be a poor whore with a big house.

(Laughs)



Is that better?



MASON

Okay.






MOM

Mason -- Mason, please, don't leave me that dirty dish to wash.



MASON

I do dishes all day.



MOM

Well, great honey, then you're a professional. Come on, you could do one or two more for you poor old mom.






MASON

Okay.



MOM

Thank you.







EXT. MOM'S HOUSE






INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN






MASON

You want one?



APRIL

Ugh. God --



MASON

(Laughing)

She didn't even touch them, seriously.









APRIL

Yeah, I bet you did watch her, you little pervert.

(Laughing)



It's like we're on a date. Cheers.






MASON

It's a night of romance.



APRIL

Yeah, except I'm not gonna kiss you.






APRIL (CONT'D)

I will blow you, though.






MR. WOOD

Mason! We are in the weeds out here!



MASON

I'm goin' as fast as I can.



MR. WOOD

Oh!











MR. WOOD (CONT'D)

Then I must be confused then, cause I just saw you chattin it up with April when I gotta salad bar that needs a refill, I gotta six top, two four tops I can't use, because they haven't been bused.



MASON

Enrique is not here. I'm tryin'.



MR. WOOD

Well, while you're tryin', we're dyin'! What am I supposed to tell my customers? "Oh, I'm sorry that your table's got dirty plates on it, but Mason's tryin'. Least that's what he told me, after he was flirtin' with April and eatin' your leftover shrimp." Now it is a challenge out there today, I know, but I wanna share somethin' with you, I got you pegged for fry cook this summer, now that's a lot more responsibility. It's also more money. How's that sound?



MASON

Good.



MR. WOOD

I know you can handle that money... but can you take the responsibility? I think you can, because I believe in you. But I need you on the floor. Now leave the dishes. Giddyup. Right, come on, don't let me down!






INT. MOM'S HOUSE - DAY






DAD

Well, so it's -- it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore?



MASON

(Holding Phone)

No , it's fine. It's up for the










DAD

(Laughing)



Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?



MASON

Yeah, she said I can stay at her dorm, which is cool, and I guess her roommate's out of town so it's no big deal.



DAD

Alright, well, did you apply there yet? Did you get that application in to UT?



MASON

Not yet, but Sheena's pretty much






DAD

Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing. You know? I mean seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants.



MASON

Yeah.



DAD

A bit of decisiveness goes a long



way in this life, alright?



MASON

Yeah.



DAD

Great. And uh, what about work?

How's that goin'?



MASON

Uh, I don't know. It's, it's alright. Today kind of sucked, this guy didn't show up. But it's definitely an interesting perspective on the world. People are slobs.



DAD

(Laughing)



Well, when people ask me about you I say, "Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up."

Alright, hey, hey, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you?






ANNIE

Say hi to your big brother. Hey,

big brother.



MASON

Hey, Annie. Hey, kiddo.



ANNIE

Can you say bye-bye?



BABY

Bye-buh!



ANNIE

(Laughs)



We'll see you soon.



DAD

(From phone)



Alright, alright, well, be careful when you're driving, alright? Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. Alright? Just, you're Obi Wan. You're centered, patient, right? You watch three cars ahead, two behind. It takes two bad drivers to have an accident okay?



MASON

Okay.



DAD

(From phone)



Right, and listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something.






MASON

Okay.



DAD

Alright, buddy! You have a good

one.







MASON

Bye, Dad.



MOM

(Motioning to the bag)

Hey, honey, take this to your sister.



Throw it in the truck, okay?



MASON

Okay, I will.



MOM

So where is Sheena staying?



MASON

At her friend Emily's.



MOM

Is Emily a real person?



MASON

(Laughing)



Yeah. Yeah, she's a sophomore. She has an apartment.



MOM

(Holding out money)

Okay, this is in case of emergency.






MASON

Okay. Thanks.



MOM

Did you do your homework?



MASON

Most of it, but... I can finish






MOM

Honey! Eleventh grade is really important for college. Don't blow it.



MASON

I know! I know. I mean, we're going to UT and everything.



MOM

I know, and don't you want me to

come? Come on, Sheena, road trip










MASON

Umm...



MOM

I'm just kidding. I have work.






MOM (CONT'D)

Call me when you get there.



MASON

I will.



MOM

Have fun!






EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/ INT. TRUCK






SHEENA

... That sounds to me like just

another extreme Mason view of






MASON

Not at all! I finally figured it out. It's like when they realized it was gonna be too expensive to actually build cyborgs and robots...

I mean, the costs of that were impossible. They decided to just let humans turn themselves into robots. That's what's going on right now.



SHEENA

Oh, right now?



MASON

Yeah! I mean, why not? There are billions of us just laying around, not really doing anything. We don't cost anything. I mean we're even pretty good at self-maintenance and reproducing constantly. And as it turns out, we're already biologically programmed for our little cyborg upgrades.







SHEENA

How?



MASON

Seriously. I read this thing other day about how, like, when you hear that ding on your inbox you get a, like a dopamine rush in your brain. It's like we're being chemically rewarded for allowing ourselves to be brainwashed. How evil is that? We're fucked.



SHEENA

So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone.



MASON

I still make fun of Trevor, though.



SHEENA

But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something.



MASON

That's just 'cause they did that

lame story about it in the school






SHEENA

And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.



MASON

That's the thing though, I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to try and not live my life through a screen. I want, like, some kind









SHEENA

Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying

something?










MASON

Yeah, okay, I know you're joking, but, I mean, it's kinda true you have been, you know, checking your phone this whole time, and so what are you really doing? You don't care what your friends are up to on Saturday afternoon but you're also obviously not fully experiencing my profound bitching so... it's like everyone's just stuck in, like, an in-between state. Not really experiencing anything.



SHEENA

It's not an experience, it's just information. Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight. Thank you very much, Facebook. And I just texted my mom back.



MASON

Oh, that's -- that's groundbreaking. She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes?



SHEENA

Oh! Oh my god, most importantly,

Meg's family just got a miniature









MASON

(looks at phone photo)

Hm!

Okay, you're right. That is a --



SHEENA

Right?



MASON

That is a really cute, tiny pig.

I want one.

It's room 2-0-6, right?

Awesome. It's not like weird that



we're staying there?



SAMANTHA

No, it's fine. Have fun.

SHEENA (O.S.)

Thank you. So how long have you

guys been dating?



SAMANTHA

About three months. Yeah, we met at a party and it's been, ya know, chill.



SHEENA

Yeah, he seems cool.



SAMANTHA

Yeah. He is.






SHEENA (O.S.)

Does he go to UT too?



SAMANTHA (O.S.)

Yeah.







SHEENA

Cool. What is he studying?



SAMANTHA

He's studying history and uh, Italian,



think?






SAMANTHA (CONT'D)

His minor, yeah.



SHEENA

Does he wanna... does he wanna teach?



SAMANTHA

I don't know, I think, I think he's

still figuring stuff out. Yeah,





about living when you come here?



SHEENA

Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm.



SAMANTHA

Yeah.



SHEENA

Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.



SAMANTHA

Yeah, you don't have to listen to your parents after you turn eighteen. I mean, especially if they're not helping you financially.






SHEENA

That's what I figured.



SAMANTHA

But I mean, living in a dorm isn't so bad.



SHEENA

Yeah.







SAMANTHA

I mean especially if it's a coed dorm. I mean, I've never been around like, so many cute guys at once. Like, college is really fun.

I'm excited.

It's great, yeah.

Look at all these people. What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?

What are WE even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?

Only then.

Anything else?

Uhhh... more queso?

Yeah.



WAITRESS

Mm-hm.






MASON

Ah, Jesus.



SHEENA

What?







MASON

I don't know, doesn't it all seem a little overwhelming? I mean, college? I mean, I like the idea of being away from home and gaining skills and getting better at photography.






SHEENA

I don't think it's that

transformative. I just see it as






MASON

But it's like a pre-ordained slot that's already got your name and number on it. I don't think it's the key to my future. Cause, like, I mean, look at my mom. She got her degree, and got a pretty good job, she can pay her bills...



SHEENA

Well, I like your mom.

Well, I like my mom, too. I just mean, basically, she's still just as fucking confused as I am.

Yeah, before you have to fend for

Yeah, yeah, that's the idea.

Yeah. Well how're feeling about it?

Excited, you know. But kind of half-excited, half-terrified.



TEACHER

Yeah, kind of that voluptuous panic.

Yeah. Exactly.



TEACHER

Well, it's gonna be good. It's gonna be crazy good. I liked college a lot better than high school. You kinda find your people in college, you know?

Exactly.

Well you'll be fine, you've got a good heart. Just follow your heart, yeah?

Thanks.

Good luck. Don't forget to floss.












EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY






SHEENA

I just don't get why you're being so fucking childish.

I'm not being childish. You're the one who made it into this big thing by telling everyone.



SHEENA

I haven't told anyone.

So Cynthia just magically knows you're going to the prom with this loser even though you're not dating him anymore?



SHEENA

She's my best friend.

Well, your best friend has a big






SHEENA

Take it up with her, then.

Why don't you just tell Miss Fuckin' Rubber Jaws she can keep on talking as long as she includes the truth, which is that we wouldn't be having this conversation if your college boyfriend weren't out of town this weekend.



SHEENA

You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just tryin' to be friends with you.

Now it's just humiliating. I can't...

I can't do that.

Fuck anyone else. I care what I think of me. Which isn't much right now. King of the Pity Prom.

Fine. We're not going.

Great.

Why are we even... I mean, we both knew this was coming. I'm just the one who did something about it.



MASON

Yeah, fucking some college guy...



SHEENA

Oh, fuck you!

(a beat)



I don't regret anything.



MASON

(Bitter Laugh)



Of course you don't.



SHEENA

You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.



MASON (O.S.)

It's great that you can think that way. And you know, I'm sure dating a jock really helps to clear the mind.



SHEENA

He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship.



MASON

Great. I feel so much better now.

We're just having fun.

I bet he's having fun.

But still honor our agreement that we pay in-state tuition, which I do appreciate. He's a prudent man, and uh, he's going to have a great future. So, here's to you buddy.

You can have one.

same.

Uh-huh. Right?

Well, we just decided to come a little early, check you out.



JIMMY

That's cool man, let me finish up,






DAD

Alright, alright.






DAD (CONT'D)

(back to Mason)



I guarantee you, you didn't do anything wrong. These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here.











DAD (CONT'D)

I mean, everyone's just changing so much. The odds of two young people staying on the same wavelength are...



MASON

Yeah, but still --



DAD

Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time.



MASON

She wasn't a silly girl, though. I mean, she's a serious person. I really thought we were --



DAD

What?



MASON

I don't know.



DAD

Here's the truth. Women are never satisfied. Ok? They're always looking to potentially trade up and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you my fine feathered friend.



MASON

What does that even mean?



DAD

It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila.



MASON

Sheena.



DAD

Alright. It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me. You. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door.



MASON

Great.







DAD

Yeah, you know, you just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way. Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter when them front-running hussies start sniffing around.



MASON

So what you're saying is, I should take up lacrosse.



DAD

Exactly. Or you could, you know, start a band. Worked for me a long time ago. I think it's still working for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking pictures.



MASON

She hated the pictures I took of






DAD

Alright. I'm sick to death of her, okay? I only met her a few times and yes she was cute, alright. But, truth be told I always thought she was a little bit, you know, a little bit too square for you. Y'know, not quite the same vibe.



MASON

You really thought that?



DAD

On some subtle, lower level. I mean, uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned out she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?

I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things. Y'know. I mean, uh, take your mom and me. Y'know I think I probably turned into the boring castrated guy she wanted me to be fifteen or twenty years ago, y'know? And man I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed. I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know, she could have been a little more patient... a little more forgiving.



MASON

Would've saved me that parade of













MASON (CONT'D)

So what's the point?



DAD

Of what?



MASON

I don't know, any of this.






DAD

Everything? What's the point? I mean I sure as shit don't know. I mean, but, neither does anybody else. Okay, we're all just winging it, you know? I mean the good news is you're feeling stuff. You know? And you got to hold onto that. You do. I mean you get older and you don't feel as much. You're skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took. Thousands of submissions from all over the state and you won.



MASON

Well, I got silver. And nine other people did, too.



DAD

I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, y'know?






JIMMY (O.S.)

Hey, this next one goes out to a






DAD

Woo-oho!



JIMMY

Known him since he was just a small boy, now he's all graduated from high school, making me feel old. Happy high school graduation, Mason.

MOM

Thank you. Okay guys, let's be clear.

I'm going to break this into four












MASON

Doesn't the apartment have like an attic, or storage or something?



MOM

No. You're missing the point. We're not going to drag a bunch of crap to mom's tiny apartment.



SAMANTHA

Can't believe we're moving again.



MOM

No, I'm moving! You moved two years ago. You have an apartment in Austin. Mason is moving the fall. I'm done. This will be great for me. I'll have all these options. I could take a sabbatical. I could get some writing done and try to get published.



MASON

What about Christmas, though? What are we gonna do?



SAMANTHA

I'm not sharing a room with him.



MOM

One of you will sleep on the couch, and we'll use that blow-up mattress.



SAMANTHA

How am I supposed to do my laundry?



MOM

Sam, I'm gently pushing you out of the nest.











MOM (CONT'D)

And on your way down you may magically find some quarters that you use to

do laundry in your own apartment. Come on! You guys are adults. You need to take some responsibility! And what do you want?

I'm gonna get the veggie burger.

I'm not having anything, not hungry.

I'm sick.

She's pregnant.



SAMANTHA

(weak laugh)



No. To be honest, I drank way too much last night.



MOM

You weren't driving, were you?



SAMANTHA

No. No. Carrie's back home, too, and we just hung out. You know, peach Smirnoffs, they just go down so easy.



MOM

No, no. Hey - that's not an excuse. You can still pack boxes. These people want to move in as soon as possible.










ERNESTO

Hi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you?

(to Mom)



Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago.



MOM

Oh, yeah.



ERNESTO

Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice! I signed up for English classes and then a year later I went to community college and I got my associates degree. And I'm working on my bachelors now at Texas State. And I'm also one of the managers here.



MOM

That's great.



ERNESTO

Uh, it's good to see you. Because I really wanted a chance to thank you for that. Gracias. It really meant a lot to me. Don't worry about lunch. It's on me. It's the least I can do.



MOM

Thanks.



ERNESTO

You guys should listen to her. She's a smart lady.



MOM

Thank you.






EXT. APARTMENT - MORNING










INT. APARTMENT - MORNING






MASON

...Isn't that kind of crazy though, that a computer knows who you are from just twenty questions off a form? I guess there are really only like eight types of people in the world.






MASON (CONT'D)

I mean there are subsets, like male and female, but apparently we're not as unique as we want to think we are.



MOM

Have you even talked to this guy



yet?



MASON

No, but we've been trading emails. He seems pretty cool. He's studying literature, and uh, anthropology, and he's way into Bright Eyes... so that's not so bad. But anyways, he was telling me about how the system they use for assigning roommates is kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen satisfaction rate for new roommates used to be like 60%, and now it's 100%. Just cause of the computer.



MOM

Well. Sounds like he'll be a good roommate, then.



MASON

Yeah. But we've pretty much decided that soon they won't even need a questionnaire. Because they'll just let the NSA scan your digital ghost, and they'll tell you who your roommate is, based on everything you've ever said, written, or clicked.










MASON (CONT'D)

Did you -- Did you put this in here again?






MASON (CONT'D)

I don't want it.



MOM

Come on, it's the first picture you ever took.



MASON

Well, I mean, all the more reason to leave it behind, right?









MASON (CONT'D)

What?



MOM

(crying)



Nothing.



MASON

No, what is it?



MOM

Nothing!



MASON

Mom...



MOM

This is the worst day of my life.



MASON

What are you talking about?



MOM

I knew this day was coming. I just -- I didn't know you were gonna be so fuckin' happy to be leaving.



MASON

I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.



What do you, what do you expect?







MOM

You know what I'm realizing? My life is just gonna go, like that! This series of milestones. Getting married, having kids, getting divorced, the time that we thought you were dyslexic, when I taught you how to ride a bike, getting divorced AGAIN, getting my masters degree, finally getting the job I wanted, sending Samantha off to college, sending YOU off the college... You know what's next? Huh? It's my fuckin' funeral!






MOM (CONT'D)

Just go, and leave my picture!






MASON

Aren't you jumping ahead by like,



forty years or something?



MOM

I just thought there would be more.

DALTON

Hey, you must be Mason.







MASON

Yeah. Dalton, right?



DALTON

Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet you.



MASON

Definitely.



DALTON

Are you cool with this side of the room?



MASON

Yeah.



DALTON

Got in this morning, just moved my shit in, man.



MASON

(laughs)

Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care.









DALTON

Cool. Can I help with anything, man? Any bags? Any last stuff you need brought in?



MASON

I just got like one... box left, I packed pretty light. But I appreciate it.



DALTON

My pleasure, man. Of course.



MASON

Um, are you goin' to the orientation mixer thing?



DALTON

Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no, man! I'm not goin' to that and neither are you, by the way. We got way better stuff to be doin', dude.






BARB

You ready?







DALTON

Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate

Mason. Mason, Barb.






MASON

Hi.



BARB

Hey. You comin' with us?



MASON

Where're you going?



BARB

Hiking.



DALTON

Yeah, man, you should come. If we leave now we can catch the late afternoon at Big Bend. You ever been before, man?



MASON

Yeah. But not since I was really

little.



DALTON

Oh, well then all the more reason to come now, man. That's why we're here, dude.






DALTON (CONT'D)

Oh, Mason. This is Nicole, Barb's roommate.



NICOLE

Hey, what's up?



MASON

Hi.






DALTON

Mason, Nicole.



BARB

(to Mason)



So, you game?







MASON

Sure.






BARB

Here. Have the rest of this. Got it timed perfectly. It'll kick in when we get to the mountains.






MASON

Awesome.



DALTON (O.S.)

Let's go.






EXT. BIG BEND - LATE AFTERNOON







MASON

Do they let you major in that here?



NICOLE

Well, it's not that serious here, so I kinda like train outside the university, but I'm taking all my basics like History of Dance and all that.



MASON

Nice.



NICOLE

Yeah.



MASON

What do you teach?



NICOLE

Oh, gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop...



MASON

Wow. Which one's your favorite?



NICOLE

Tap.







MASON

Yeah?



NICOLE

Yeah. You can make up all your own sounds and there's no rules.



MASON

Right...



NICOLE

Just, like, creative freedom.



MASON

That's great.



NICOLE

Yeah.



MASON

Right.



NICOLE

... So to be a part of bringing it back to the kids...



MASON

Right, keep it going.



NICOLE

... Is really rewarding. Yeah.



MASON

How old are they?



NICOLE

Six to eight.



MASON

(laughs)



Wow.



NICOLE

(laughing)



Yeah. They have like no fear, and they're not self-conscious at all.



MASON

They haven't reached the awkward






NICOLE

Yeah, not yet. It's coming.










EXT. HIKE - LATER






NICOLE

Hey.






NICOLE (CONT'D)

Dalton can be crazy sometimes.



MASON

He seems cool, though.



NICOLE

Yeah. Yeah, they're both really

cool. How are you feeling?






MASON

Great. Really great, to be honest.



NICOLE

Good. I'm really happy that you're hangin' out with us.



MASON

Yeah. Me too.






DALTON (O.S.)

This moment's having a multiple orgasm! It's like as if all of time has unfolded before us so we can stand here and look out and scream - Fuck yea!! Wooo!






NICOLE

You know how everyone's always saying, "Seize the moment"?










NICOLE (CONT'D)

I don't know, I'm kinda thinkin' it's the other way around. You know, like, the moment seizes us.



MASON

Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant, the moments, it's just... it's like always right now, you know?



NICOLE

Yeah.
