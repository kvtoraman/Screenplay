(CONT'D)	Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was the stimulus, that he used? Come on now, people! Tough weekend? What's the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat. Meat powder, actually. Whatever meat powder is, it worked on this dog. Okay. He put the meat powder in there and it produced an unconditioned response in the dog, which was? Salivation. Alright. Now, who can give me another example of an unconditioned stimulus-response pair that happens to you everyday. It's probably happening to some of you right now.(pause)How about sex? Sure, you know. You see an attractive member of the opposite gender, you have an automatic response. You don't have to think about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song about... Oh, when they call your name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog.	BILL (CONT'D)	 Thank you very much. Class dismissed.	 MOM (O.S.)	Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason.

MOM (O.S.)	His cognitive series, his interviews with orphans, Ethology theorists' work... And then he in turn was supported strongly by Harry Harlow's rhesus monkey study. Now you guys, you gotta think, this is the 1950's, this was radical! This flew in the face of traditional learning theory, of B.F. Skinner's classical and instrumental conditioning. Now, Bowlby is going to argue that human survival depends on us falling in love. It depends on me falling in love with my mother, and my mother falling in love with me. And if that doesn't happen, we're pretty much doomed. Now think about it. A tiger chases our tribe out of a cave. Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My baby! I love you! I'll protect you!" Or... "Well you, why am I going to pick you up? You're going to slow me down. You... are... tiger kibble!"	MOM (CONT'D)	So next week we are gonna get into Bowlby's four stages of attachment -- oh oh, uh, Professor Douglas and I -- some of you might have classes with Elena -- she and I are hosting a little pre-Thanksgiving get-together at my place, so if anyone wants to come, please stop by.(pause)I'm not the greatest cook...

It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.	TONY	I'm not in the fucking marching band.	SENIOR GUY	Ah dude, you sure? I heard you play the skin flute.

I mean, you're not... Ughh.Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, alright, but bottom line is that was my car.Alright? I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it but when you get older you can save up and buy a car of your own. And be cool like I used to be. Or... you can get a mini-van.	ANNIE	Does your mom actually let you watch this?	SAMANTHA	 Yeah. She likes it too.
SAMANTHA	 Yeah. She likes it too.	ANNIE	(laughing) Oh, my god... Okay, well.	SAMANTHA	Yeah.	ANNIE	Have you ever seen her in concert?

Hard livin's gonna be the end of me."

MOM	No, no. Hey - that's not an excuse. You can still pack boxes. These people want to move in as soon as possible.	ERNESTO	 Hi guys. I'm Ernesto, how are you?(to Mom)Uh, you probably don't remember me, but I worked on your septic line years ago.	MOM	Oh, yeah.	ERNESTO	Believe it or not, you changed my life. Yeah, you told me that day that I was smart and that I should go to school. I took your advice!
