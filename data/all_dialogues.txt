GOD!"		TEACHER (0.S.)	  Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment on what you've read so far?	BIANCA	 Not really.	TEACHER	 Mandella -- since you're assisting us, you might as well comment.  I'm assuming you read the assignment.	10 Things I Hate About You 	continuing
MANDELIA	 The whole folio.  All the plays.	TEACHER	  You've read every play by William Shakespeare?	MANDELLA	 Haven't you?			10 Things I Hate About You 	disbelieving
KAT	 Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.	JOEY	  They're running the rest of me next month.

WALTER	 (continuing) Do you know what this is?	BIANCA AND WALTER	  The sound of a fifteen-year-old in labor.	WALTER	 This is why you're not dating until your sister does.	BIANCA	 But she doesn't want to date.	10 Things I Hate About You 	in unison, by rote
SHARON	 Tumescent!	WALTER	  You're not helping.					10 Things I Hate About You 	to Sharon; as he leaves

TREVOR	 You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister.	MANDELLA	  It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a political figure.  I do not live in South Africa.  My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries.	TREVOR	 But you freed our people	MANDELLA	 Your "people" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I have not freed you, Trevor. (grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself.	10 Things I Hate About You 	rotely

KAT	 Doubtful.  Very doubtful.	PATRICK	  You're no bargain either, sweetheart.	SCURVY	 So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt.	MICHAEL	 He took the bait.	10 Things I Hate About You 	calling after her
WALTER	 You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.	KAT	  I want to go to an East Coast school!

MICHAEL	 Dead at forty-one.	PATRICK	 Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?	MICHAEL	 Just for now.	CAMERON	 Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys.	10 Things I Hate About You 	spits the word out
MICHAEL	 I also retrieved a list of her most recent CD purchases, courtesy of American Express.	PATRICK	  Michael -- did you get this information "illegally"?

PATRICK/KAT	 Yeah/No.	MISS PERKY	  Dear God, stay away from her.  If you two ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth.					10 Things I Hate About You 	to Patrick
KAT	 Can we go now?	WALTER	  Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	BIANCA	 Why?	WALTER	 Because she'll scare them away.	10 Things I Hate About You 	to Bianca
KAT	 Leave my sister alone.	JOEY	  And why would I do that?	JOCK	 A fight!	COFFEE KID #1	 That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.	10 Things I Hate About You 	smirking
PATRICK	 What's this?	KAT	  "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?	PATRICK	 I say, do what you wanna do.	KAT	 Funny, you're the only one	10 Things I Hate About You 	mocking
KAT	 Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --	BIANCA	  I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.					10 Things I Hate About You 	cutting her off

CAMERON	 Sure	PATRICK	  Then, go get her					10 Things I Hate About You 	impatient
PATRICK	 I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.	KAT	  Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?	PATRICK	 (slightly sarcastic) I thought you were above all that	KAT	 You know what they say	10 Things I Hate About You 	holding up a drunken head
KAT	 (holding up a drunken head) Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?	PATRICK	  I thought you were above all that	KAT	 You know what they say	PATRICK	 No. What do they say?	10 Things I Hate About You 	slightly sarcastic

CAMERON	 You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?	BIANCA	  Well, no...	CAMERON	 Then that's all you had to say.	BIANCA	 But	10 Things I Hate About You 	reluctant
DEREK	 Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of my heart.	CLEM	 Yippe kai-aye, bra.  Dance for me, cowgirl.	CLEM	 (continuing) Okay, now tell me again why he didn't shoot the deputy?	DEREK	 Because the deputy meant him no harm, my friend.  It was only the sheriff that was the oppressor.	10 Things I Hate About You 	to Kat
MRS. BLAISE	 (continuing) Derek?	DEREK	  In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas 'd to dote.	CLEM	 Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as a laxative on my person.			10 Things I Hate About You 	reading; in his Rasta stoner drawl

PATRICK	 Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.	KAT	  What are you doing here?	PATRICK	 I heard there was a poetry reading.	KAT	 You 're so --	10 Things I Hate About You 	frowning
PATRICK	 Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.	CAMERON	  You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.

BIANCA	 Come in.	KAT	  Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.	BIANCA	 Like you care.	KAT	 I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .	10 Things I Hate About You 	kindly
KAT	 In 9th.  For a month	BIANCA	  Why?	KAT	 (self-mocking) He was, like, a total babe	BIANCA	 But you hate Joey	10 Things I Hate About You 	confused
BIANCA	 (confused) Why?	KAT	  He was, like, a total babe	BIANCA	 But you hate Joey	KAT	 Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.	10 Things I Hate About You 	self-mocking
BIANCA	 You did what?	KAT	  Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.	BIANCA	 But	KAT	 After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --	10 Things I Hate About You 	continuing on
KAT	 After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since.

KAT	 No, Daddy.	WALTER	  So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?	KAT	 Parts of it.	WALTER	 Which parts?	10 Things I Hate About You 	dreading the answer
WALTER	 (continuing) You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.	KAT	  When I go?	WALTER	 Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.			10 Things I Hate About You 	hopeful

KAT	 Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?	MISS PERKY	 Just smack her now.	10 Things I Hate About You 	to Kat
