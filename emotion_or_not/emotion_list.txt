pausing in the doorway
moving across the room
lights a cigarette
they both laugh
pulls up a chair
hands over a tub of icecream
stroking her hair
lighting up

not looking up

puzzled
assumes the birth position and looks between her legs
stepping forward
hauling her away

grimly
picking up the papers

embraces nate and whispers
at richie's eyes
richie doesn't reach for his wallet
smiling; happy
looks at the room

he doesn't say whether it is or not
she doesn't
taking a .45 from jimmy's pocket
joking
gives the gun back
peels off some money

kisses her cheek
no one else emerges

catching on
a loud, happy squawk
dazed
nods in agreement
convinced she's gone mad
miserably
the same
no answer from birdie
breaks in; sharply
smile
eve turns at the door
gasps
she smiles shyly
eve holds it up; karen whistles
hesitantly
pauses, smiles
she picks at the coverlet
she looks up, rises as she speaks
nods proudly
she sits beside eve
pointing
she hold up the coat
as birdie and the sables pass
getting up
pitching
abruptly

suddenly
karen pauses
she zips margo
she starts tidying the room

deferentially
icily
somberly
sympathetic
she finishes her drink, stands up

staggered
pacing
weakly
put out his cigarette
gets up

carefully
he quiets down
eyes still on bill
eyes still on margo
he lifts his glass
angrily
looking about
she smiles grimly
leading her on
turned away
she gets up, her hand still on eve's shoulder
cold, relentless
pours
thoughtfully
breaks in
bill says "huh?"
blissfully
lloyd nods
explodes
hastily
then quietly
goes right on
he holds out his hand
blandly
turns; shocked
as she sits
increasingly tense
meaningly
cautiously
moving away
wisely
they are now facing each other
curtly
whirls on him
he lets go of her hands
applause
sits
patiently
she holds up the award
she gives him the award
shyly
stubbornly
sleepy; from the living room
re: a memo he's been looking at
reading the cover
handing him her license
exited
back in the phone
affectionately
through intercom
reading the note
standing up, smiling
of course she is
speaking up
the meeting's over
singing softly
exciting
meant for lewis
shouting through the phone
re the book

inexplicably moved, covers
while tying
at ringside, on radio

all at once
droll
mumbles, half-asleep
cautioning
not a thought
cold
and ultimately
concerned for her husband

glares at them
wry
thinks; decides: go
can't hear
repeating
drops facade
he hesitates; he's sorry, but
she doesn't get it
on a roll
running on
against me
not hearing
tears flow
over the drumming
suspicious
sees it all
pissed, dissed big
irrepressible
double entendre
looking at her admiringly
hesitating; low
eyes go wide
high-pitched voice, imitating female fans
looks down at her, intensely
lunges for wife's note pad
breaking through
concedes
meaning sadler
tight
it's not the first time
sarcasm falls away
from doorway
praying
off herbert's look
looks up
past the ref; eyeballing george
blows up
calmly
distant echoes
he glances around the room

re: image on tv
on her way out
nervous
cheerful
a grin
loving this
irritable
taken aback
hugs her
his voice thick
a whisper
hoarse
offering his beer
his voice husky
compassionate
snooping over his shoulder
clearing his throat
on the verge  of tears
he looks at her as she wipes her eyes.
looking for matches
she smiles at  curt.
opening his ticket book
realizing it's coming out wrong he gets nervous
she looks out the  window, down at vic's pants
his voice cracks
she kisses him
looking at the tray
smiling at al
he looks at her for a moment
putting his arm around curt
looking at curt in the back
she suddenly smiles
grinning at carol
he notices a car nearby and pushes  himself up
shaking his head
nudging alvy
puffing on his cigarette and  nodding
his head still down
excited, gesturing with her hands
heartily, looking down at alvy
making noises
first off screen, then onscreen as  classroom
still sitting in the back of  the classroom
gesturing
with young, alvy still at her side
nodding his head
nervously
overlapping, ignoring alvy
overlapping 1st man
still ignoring alvy's protestations
also ignoring alvy
holding out a matchbook
overlapping, alvy's  speech
taking the matchbook and pen and  writing
overlapping the two men and  stuttering
overlapping alvy
hitting his hand on the counter
overlapping annie
alvy nods his head yes and let's out an exasperated sigh
watching people with tickets move  past them
annie nods her head and shrugs  her
laughing now
overlapping the man's speech
overlapping alvy and annie
sighing
gasping
wringing his hands
lighting a cigarette while he talks
still going on
even louder now
more and more aggravated
sighing and addressing the audience
over credits and soldiers
overlapping annie, reacting
overlapping annie again
looking down at the clipboard
he starts laughing nervously
off screen, onstage
above the chatter around him
looking out at the stage
still looking off screen
clears his throat
propping one knee on the bed  and gesturing
hysterically
overlapping alvy and making sounds
picking up the lobster annie  placed on the counter earlier
reluctantly alvy picks up the  another picture
off screen, laughing
still watching
squinting
taking robin's hand
looking at robin
pulling away again
reaching over for her eyeglasses  on the night table
hitting the halt back
looking over his shoulder
hands clasped in front of her,  smiling
making sounds and laughing
still looking over his shoulder
turning and aiming her thumb over  her shoulder
annie smiles, hands folded in  front of her
zipping up his bag
making sounds
finally reacting
a bit rapidly
he pulls a half-eaten sandwich  out of her bag
laughing and nodding her head
overlapping, gesturing
annie laughs
sipping her wine and laughing
nodding, her hand on her hip
putting his band on his forehead
they laugh
she turns and looks at alvy,  then laughs
lighting a joint and laughing
he pushes himself up from the  bed and looks down at annie
looking at the books alvy  is bolding
over annie's laughter
watching two men approach, one  lighting a cigar
as another man walks by
putting his arms around her neck
putting pictures on the mantel
looking up at alvy
still sitting on the bed
looking at annie
whistling
he puts his arms around her neck,  sounds
closing the door
kissing her
laughing and making sounds
kissing and caressing annie
overlapping above speech
over lapping above speech
smiling at duane
chewing
smacking his lips
setting down his glass and coughing
walking in
reacting and clearing his throat
calling after him
taking groceries from the bag
taking a bottle of juice and  some celery from the bag
pointing her finger at alvy
turning, ajar in her hand
putting away some groceries
yelling out, angry
the maharisbi, a small, chunky  policemen bold back the crowds
rubbing his chin and shoulder
opening the door
they look at each other, annie  sighing
interrupting, sighing
following him
thumbing through the book
looking down at the magazine
sitting down on a chair arm  and looking up at alvy
rising from chair
upset, hands on her neck
opening a closet door
holding the racquet
alvy turns and starts swapping  down articles and breaking glass
sobbing and taking alvy's arm
leaning on his shoulder
snickering
turning away
addressing the young girl
grabbing the young girl's cheek
looking up at alvy and laughing
opening the gift
looking at alvy, smiling
looking for the first time at alvy
staring at annie and clearing  his throat
looking at alvy, reacting
looking down at her hands,  then up at alvy
simultaneously, with annie
simultaneously, with alvy
counting on his fingers
all four are now sitting on the  reacting
moving forward on the couch
over the singing
singing over the dialogue
singing, louder now
removing his glasses and  rubbing his face
overlapping the tv
sitting down
crouching before alvy, looking  at him
holding out the food
taking a piece of chicken and  holding it
sitting on the edge of the bed
grabbing the rest of the chicken  from the plate
making sounds, gasping
watching the woman in white
in unison
taking alvy's arm
as she sips coffee
an open magazine lies in  his lap
looking back at alvy
he sighs
putting down the books and  flipping back her hair
riffling through the books
holding a framed picture and  moving about
looking down at a book
patting alvy's shoulder
walking in with another  armload of books
smoking
still leaning against the sink,  her hand on her hip
alvy adjusts his glasses, not  a bit uneasy
adjusting her sunglasses
sadly
still smiling
nodding his head and gesturing
seriously
in disbelief
shrugging his shoulders
he gets up and starts following  her past diners at other tables
yelling after her
searching, he finally fishes  his license out of his pocket
looking at the piece of paper  on the ground
he laughs
carrying his jacket over his  shoulder
starting the car
looking at rob's helmet
in mirrored reflection
rising with emotion
over the theater scene and,  annie's singing
