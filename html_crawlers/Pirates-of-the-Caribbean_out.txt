ELIZABETH	 ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...	GIBBS	 (sotto) Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You want to call 'em down on us?	NORRINGTON	 Mr. Gibbs.	NORRINGTON (CONT'D)	 That will do.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
NORRINGTON	 Consider them marked.   On your way.	GIBBS	 'Aye, Captain. (as he moves off) Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one.	ELIZABETH	 I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.	NORRINGTON	 Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and dissolute creatures, the  lot of them. I intend to see to   it that any man who sails under a  pirate flag, or wears a pirates  brand, gets what he deserves: a  short drop and a sudden stop.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
NORRINGTON	 An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.	GIBBS	 Lot of good it did them... (off Swan's look) Everyone's thinking it! I'm just saying it! Pirates!	SWAN	 There is no proof of that. It could have been an accident. Captain, these men were protection. If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!	NORRINGTON	 Of course not, Governor. (to the crew) Come about and strike the sails! Unlash the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off the cannons! (to Swann) Hope for the best...prepare for the worst. (to two sailors) Move the boy aft. We'll need the deck clear.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
SWAN	 There is no proof of that. It could have been an accident. Captain, these men were protection. If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!	NORRINGTON	 Of course not, Governor. (to the crew) Come about and strike the sails! Unlash the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off the cannons! (to Swann) Hope for the best...prepare for the worst. (to two sailors) Move the boy aft. We'll need the deck clear.	SWAN	 Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy. He's in your charge now. You'll watch over him?	ELIZABETH	 My name is Elizabeth Swann.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 I knew it.	SWANN	 Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a fine gentleman, don't you think? (no answer) He fancies you, you know.	SWANN (CONT'D)	 Elizabeth?     How's it coming?	ELIZABETH	 Difficult ... to say.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
SWANN (O.S.)	 I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.	ELIZABETH	 (holding her breath) Women in London must have learned to not breath.	BUTLER	 Governor? A caller is here for you.	SWANN	 Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see you again!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
SWANN	 Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see you again!	WILL	 Good day, sir. (holds out the case) I have your order.	WILL (CONT'D)		WILL (CONT'D)	 The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may -	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
SWANN	 Impressive. .. very impressive. Commodore Norrington will be pleased, I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to your master.	WILL	 (bows slightly) I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated --	SWANN	 Elizabeth! You look stunning!	ELIZABETH	 Will! It's so good to see you!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
SWANN	 Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate -	ELIZABETH	 (ignores her father) About the day we met. Do you remember?	WILL	 I could never forget it, Miss Swann.	ELIZABETH	 Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
MURTOGG	 Right. Commodore Norrington.	JACK	 That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- (indicates the Dauntless) -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous.	MURTOGG	 Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.	JACK	 That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
MURTOGG	 ... no.	MULLR0Y	 (turns back to Jack) Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!	MULLROY (CONT'D)	 You!	MULLROY (CONT'D)	 Get away from there! You don't have permission to be aboard there!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 I can't breathe.	NORRINGTON	 (smiles) I'm a bit nervous, myself --	NORRINGTON (CONT'D)	 Elizabeth! .	GILLETTE	 The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she missed them!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
MULLR0Y	 I can't swim.	JACK	 (rolls his eyes) Sailors.	JACK (CONT'D)	 Fine.	JACK (CONT'D)	 Don't lose these.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
MURTOGG	 He said he'd come to commandeer one.	MULLROY	 (to Murtogg) I told you he was telling the truth. (currying favor) These are his, sir.	NORRINGTON	 (to Jack) Extra powder, but no additional shot.	NORRINGTON (CONT'D)	 It doesn't bear true.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
MULLROY	 (to Murtogg) I told you he was telling the truth. (currying favor) These are his, sir.	NORRINGTON	 (to Jack) Extra powder, but no additional shot.	NORRINGTON (CONT'D)	 It doesn't bear true.	NORRINGTON (CONT'D)	 I half-expected it to be made of wood.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 But it seems to be enough to condemn him.	NORRINGTON	 (smiles) Indeed.	JACK	 Finally.	JACK (CONT'D)	 (backing away, toward land) Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and belt, please.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK (CONT'D)	 Now, if you'll be very kind?	ELIZABETH	 (as she works) You are despicable.	JACK	 I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.	JACK (CONT'D)	 Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK (CONT'D)	 Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.	NORRINGTON	 On his heels! Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort! (to Elizabeth) Elizabeth, are you -	ELIZABETH	 Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.	SWANN	 Here, dear ... you should wear this.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.	JACK	 You need to find yourself a girl. (Will sets his jaw) Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?	WILL	 No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ... I can kill him.	WILL (CONT'D)	 You cheated.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL (CONT'D)	 You cheated.	JACK	 (smiles; what do you expect?) Pirate.	JACK (CONT'D)	 Move away.	WILL	 No.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK (CONT'D)	 It's the Black Pearl.	PRISONER	 (frightened) The Black Pearl? I've heard stories ... she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years ... and never leaves any survivors.	JACK	 There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.	NORRINGTON	 Governor! Barricade yourself in my office! (Swann hesitates) That's an order!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.	NORRINGTON	 Governor! Barricade yourself in my office! (Swann hesitates) That's an order!	NORRINGTON (CONT'D)	 They've flanked us! Men! Swords and pistols!	PINTEL	 Up there!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PRISIONER	 Praise be!	PRISONER (CONT'D)	 (back to Jack) My sympathies, friend - - you've no manner of luck at all!	JACK	 It's all right, doggie ... come here,	JACK (CONT'D)	 What's the matter, boy?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
TWIGG	 This isn't the armory.	KOEHLER	 (Dutch accent) Well, well... Look what we have here, Twigg. It's. Captain Sparrow.	TWIGG	 Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it.	KOEHLER	 Did you sprout little wings and flyaway?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 I want you to leave. And never come back.	BARBOSSA	 I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. (helpfully) Means' No. '	ELIZABETH	 Very well.	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	 I'll drop it!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.	BARBOSSA	 (interested) Did you, now?	ELIZABETH	 Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it.	BARBOSSA		Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 You have a name, missy?	ELIZABETH	 Elizabeth - (stops herself from saying "Swann"; then:) Turner. (embroidering) I'm a maid in the governor's household. (curtsies) Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.	BARBOSSA	 You've got sand, for a maid.	ELIZABETH	 (curtsies again) Thank you, sir.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA	 You've got sand, for a maid.	ELIZABETH	 (curtsies again) Thank you, sir.	BARBOSSA	 And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?	ELIZABETH	 Of course. (offended) I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA	 And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?	ELIZABETH	 Of course. (offended) I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.	BARBOSSA	 No, no, nothing like that. (comes to a decision) Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.	ELIZABETH	 Can I trust you?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 Of course. (offended) I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.	BARBOSSA	 No, no, nothing like that. (comes to a decision) Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.	ELIZABETH	 Can I trust you?	BARBOSSA	 It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 We have to hunt them down -- and save her!	SWANN	 Where do you propose we start? If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone does, tell me! (Will is silent) Leave, Mr. Turner.	MURTOGG	 That Jack Sparrow... he talked about the Black Pearl.	MULLROY	 Mentioned it, is more what he did.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 We could strike a bargain -	NORRINGTON	 No. The pirates who invaded   this fort left Sparrow locked in   his cell. Ergo, he is not their   ally, and therefore of no value. (through with Will) We will determine their most likely course, and launch a   search mission that sails with the   tide.	WILL	 That's not good enough. This is Elizabeth's life!	NORRINGTON	 Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions. (low) Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth. (firm) Now, go home.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 That's not good enough. This is Elizabeth's life!	NORRINGTON	 Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions. (low) Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth. (firm) Now, go home.	WILL	 Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?	JACK	 Somewhat.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 And you want to turn pirate yourself?	WILL	 Never. (beat) They took Miss Swann.	JACK	 (he was right) So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.	WILL	 I can get you out of here.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 Never. (beat) They took Miss Swann.	JACK	 (he was right) So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.	WILL	 I can get you out of here.	JACK	 How? The key's run off.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 How? The key's run off.	WILL	 (examines the cell) I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . .	JACK	 Your name is Turner.	WILL	 Yes. Will Turner.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 Yes. Will Turner.	JACK	 Will Turner... (he stands) I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl. (sticks out his hand) Do we have an accord?	WILL	 Agreed.	JACK	 Agreed!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL (CONT'D)	 Why are you bothering with that?	JACK	 My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. (joins Will at the door) This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?	WILL	 (no hesitation) I'd die for her.	JACK	 Good.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. (joins Will at the door) This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?	WILL	 (no hesitation) I'd die for her.	JACK	 Good.	JACK (O.S.)	 Ah, now there's a lovely sight!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK (CONT'D)	 Come aboard.	WILL	 I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. (regards the boat) It's been a sound policy.	JACK	 No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.	JACK (CONT'D)	 Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 It's still against the law.	JACK	 So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start. (smiling) My advice -- smile and enjoy it.	WILL	 This is either crazy, or brilliant.	JACK	 Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!	WILL	 (a beat) Aye! Avast!	GILLETTE	 You're serious about this.	JACK	 Dead serious.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.	GILLETTE	 (a curt nod) Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.	JACK	 As likely as not. (calling) Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!	JACK	 A little help?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
GILLETTE	 (a curt nod) Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.	JACK	 As likely as not. (calling) Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!	JACK	 A little help?	MURTOGG	 I can't believe he's doing this.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
MULLROY	 You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either.	GILLETTE	 (over his shoulder, to Will) Do you have any idea, boy, what you're doing?	WILL	 No.	JACK	 Lookee there, mate! We're underway!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
NORRINGTON	 Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges!	JACK	 Can you swim? (the man struggles) Can. You. Swim?	SENTRY	 Of course, sir. Like a fish. I grew up summers living in Dover, with my uncle -	JACK	 Good.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
NORRINGTON	 We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.	GILLETTE	 Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons! (to Norrington) We are to fire on our own ship?	NORRINGTON	 Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.	STEERSMAN	 Captain, there's a problem.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.	PINTEL	 (happy) He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.	PINTEL (CONT'D)	 (hands it over) Fine.	BARBOSSA	 Maid or not, it fits you.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.	WILL	 I worked passage   from England as a cabin boy. (an attempt  at guile) After my mother  passed, I came out here ... looking  for my father.	JACK	 Is that so?	WILL	 My father. William Turner?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Good man. Good pirate. And clever -"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.	WILL	 (angry) That's not true.	JACK	 I swear, you look just like him.	WILL	 It's not true that my father was a pirate.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--	JACK	 (laughs) You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'	WILL	 My father did not think of my mother -his family -- as a burden.	JACK	 Sure -- because he could always go pirating.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 Just do it quickly.	JACK	 (rubbing his jaw) Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster -- there!	ANAMARIA	 You stole my boat.	JACK	 AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together -	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 You'll get it back. Or one better.	ANAMARIA	 (a threat) I will.	WILL	 Jack! Over here!	WILL (CONT'D)	 He knows Gibbs.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL (CONT'D)	 He knows Gibbs.	GIBBS	 Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot (recognizes Jack) Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!	JACK	 Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.	GIBBS	 Aye, that'll about do it.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.	GIBBS	 (shakes his head) A fool's errand.	JACK	 Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.	GIBBS	 And you've got that, have you?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner.	GIBBS	 Well, lookee there. I'll allow you may be onto something, Jack. (considers, nods) There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. I'll find some men.	GIBBS (CONT'D)	 Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?	JACK	 That he is.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 That he is.	GIBBS	 Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt -- (sotto, making his point) -- and crazy, to boot.	ANAMARIA	 You owe me a boat.	GIBBS	 Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out --	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
GIBBS	 Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'	JACK	 That goes for the rest of you! Danger and near certain death. (turns away) For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann. An equal share of the reward shall be -	WILL	 Shut up, before you lose them all!	JACK	 These are the only ones worth having. (glances at the sky) And we're going to need them-	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 Shut up, before you lose them all!	JACK	 These are the only ones worth having. (glances at the sky) And we're going to need them-	GIBBS	 That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides!	GIBBS (CONT'D)	 Werd best drop canvas, sirl	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 She can hold a bit longer.	GIBBS	 (shouts) What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?	JACK	 (shouts) We're catching up!	TWIGG	 Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta, off the port bow!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
GIBBS	 (shouts) What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?	JACK	 (shouts) We're catching up!	TWIGG	 Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta, off the port bow!	JACOBY	 Orders, Captain?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK (CONT'D)	 Six points port!	GIBBS	 Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun, or it's bad luck! (twirls a finger) Anty-clockwise.	WILL	 How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?	GIBBS	 Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. (voice low) That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?	GIBBS	 Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. (voice low) That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie.	WILL	 Really? (moves closer) So ... what's the story on the pistol?	GIBBS	 I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
GIBBS	 Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. (voice low) That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie.	WILL	 Really? (moves closer) So ... what's the story on the pistol?	GIBBS	 I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -	WILL	 What? He never told me that.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 What? He never told me that.	GIBBS	 Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share. (lowers his voice) So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the bearings. (shakes his head) That night, there was mutiny.	GIBBS (CONT'D)	 Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.	WILL	 How did he get off the island?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 How did he get off the island?	JACK	 (loud) I didn't!	JACK (CONT'D)	 My body's still there, rotting away, and I am but a ghost!	GIBBS	 How did you get off the island?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
KOEHLER	 Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.	BARBOSSA	 Hah! (to the pirates) Be mindful of pits and crevasses. Stay together.	BARBOSSA	 Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day -- for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here.	COTTON'S PARROT	 Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND ho!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 What did you expect? We're all gentlemen here, right and proper.	BARBOSSA	 You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted? (grins) Eat a whole bushel of apples.	BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 What was begun by blood, let blood now end!	KOEHLER	 Did it work?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
KOEHLER	 You're not dead.	JACOBY	 No. (realizes) He shot me!	TWIGG	 It didn't work! The curse is still upon us!	BARBOSSA	 You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?! (grabs her roughly) Was your father William Turner?!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
TWIGG	 It didn't work! The curse is still upon us!	BARBOSSA	 You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?! (grabs her roughly) Was your father William Turner?!	ELIZABETH	 No.	BARBOSSA	 Where's his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?! Where?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA	 Where's his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?! Where?	JACOBY	 (to Pintel) You brought us the wrong person!	PINTEL	 She had the medallion! She's the right age. She said her name was Turner!	TWIGG	 (to Barbossa) You brought us here for nothing?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 She had the medallion! She's the right age. She said her name was Turner!	TWIGG	 (to Barbossa) You brought us here for nothing?	BARBOSSA	 If you had sailed with Morgan for ten years like I have, you'd know not to question me!	BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! Any more talk, I'll chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 You?!	WILL	 Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you! (sounds of pursuit, approaching) It's going badly!	JACK	 This way!	WILL	 I'm glad we got here in time.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 Come on!	JACK	 No. This won't work. (a quick decision) I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.	WILL	 No.	JACK	 I'll lead them away.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 Now?	BARBOSSA (NODS)	 Now. (Pintel grins) No, don't kill him.	BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.	JACK	 Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.	BARBOSSA	 The Pearl? (laughs) Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?	JACK	 You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.	BARBOSSA	 That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.	BARBOSSA	 You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that. (decides, smiles) We might just have to sign articles, you and I. Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.	BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 Pintel ... set sail. If this fool plan is to work, we'll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which brought 'em here.	JACK	 What -- you don't have the medallion?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 I'll watch my back.	BARBOSSA	 Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig. (to Jack, a smile) Meaning no disrespect, of course.	GIBBS	 Two women on board? A man don't have to be superstitious to know that's trouble.	ELIZABETH	 ... you were in danger ... so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 If I had known-	ELIZABETH	 (anticipating him) -- then we never would have met.	WILL	 I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.	ELIZABETH	 I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA	 All hands! Prepare to come about!	JACK	 Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel - (to Twigg) I'm a little conflicted, here.	BARBOSSA	 Strike your colors, you bloody cockroaches!	ANAMARIA	 Looks like they mean to send us under.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid -	WILL	 My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. (raises the gun to his head) You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!	TWIGG	 It's true - he's the spittin' image of old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!	BARBOSSA	 Looks like you're back to having nothing to offer.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 And hers got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!	BARBOSSA	 Enough of that! (to Will) Name your terms.	WILL	 Elizabeth goes free!	BARBOSSA	 We got that part. Anything else?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 Hah. Look there. That's the very same island we made Jack governor of on our last trip. (nods") When you sail the open sea as long as I, you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way.	GIBBS	 (dejected) Amen to that...	BARBOSSA	 Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick. (loudly) Men, break out the plank!	WILL	 No! You gave your word!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
GIBBS	 (dejected) Amen to that...	BARBOSSA	 Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick. (loudly) Men, break out the plank!	WILL	 No! You gave your word!	BARBOSSA	 Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. (nods) I agreed to set them free. I didn't say when. .. nor where.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 No! You gave your word!	BARBOSSA	 Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. (nods) I agreed to set them free. I didn't say when. .. nor where.	JACK	 It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.	BARBOSSA	 Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 That's proper, sir, according to the code.	BARBOSSA	 By the Powers, you're right! ( turns around) Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!	JACK	 A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.	BARBOSSA	 Tell you what. I'll   give you one pistol, and let you   be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death yourself! (grins) That is, presuming   you're not both drownded.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.	BARBOSSA	 Tell you what. I'll   give you one pistol, and let you   be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death yourself! (grins) That is, presuming   you're not both drownded.	BARBOSSA (CONTID)	 So how did you get off that island, anyway?	JACK	 You can go to your grave not knowing.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!	JACK	 You're right. (hoists the bottle) Here's luck to you, Will Turner.	JACK (CONT'D)	 Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.	ELIZABETH	 Not when you can drink instead, at least.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	 (under her breath) Drink up me hearties, yo ho...	JACK	 What? What was that? (Elizabeth smiles) Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Please,	ELIZABETH	 Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.	JACK	 I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK/ELIZABETH	 Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!	JACK	 I LOVE this song! (sings) Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters, ne'er do well cads, Drink up me hearties, yo ho! (gives it a touch of Irish ballad) Aye but we're loved by our mums and our dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!	JACK   (CONT'D)	 When I get the   Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach   it to the whole crew, and we'll sing   it all the time!	ELIZABETH	 You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 Ah, well... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.	ELIZABETH	 (coy) Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.	JACK	 We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.	ELIZABETH	 To freedom.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 They'll be no living with her after this.	NORRINGTON	 Elizabeth, I'm" relieved you're safe. (re: Jack) Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.	ELIZABETII	 Commodore, you can't do that!	NORRINGTON	 You're speaking up for him again?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
ELIZABETH	 He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.	JACK	 (she's right) We had time to get to know each other.	NORRINGTON	 We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.	ELIZABETH	 No. The pirates have taken Will -	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
JACK	 They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?	NORRINGTON	 (looks at him) Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.	JACK	 (smiles) I knew you'd listen to reason!	JACK	 That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
NORRINGTON	 (looks at him) Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.	JACK	 (smiles) I knew you'd listen to reason!	JACK	 That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.	NORRINGTON	 I'll be at the wheel myself.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.	BARBOSSA	 Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. (grins) Best play it safe, and spill it all.	PINTEL	 I guess there is a reason to fret.	BARBOSSA	 Careful, now. You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)	 You couldn't have led him back more directly if you knew exactly where you were going.	WILL	 You did know where you were going! You did lead us directly to them! (Jack's silence confirms it) Why?	BARBOSSA	 What was begun by blood, let blood now end!	JACK	 You don't want to be doing that.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA	 No, I really think I do.	JACK	 (shrugs) All right then.	BARBOSSA	 Why don't I want to do this?	JACK	 Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
PINTEL	 Do you believe him?	BARBOSSA	 No. (indicates Will) But him I believe. He is genuinely angry.	JACK	 You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.	BARBOSSA	 What're you suggesting?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
BARBOSSA	 That so?	JACK	 Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas. (beat) But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?	JACK (CONT'D)	 I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.' (sticks out his hand) Do we have an accord?	JACK (CONT'D)	 Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
TALL SAILOR	 Ship rats. Big ones.	SHORT SAILOR	 (nods) Hate those things.	SHORT SAILOR (CONT'D)	 Taste all right, though.	TALL SAILOR	 That they do.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
WILL	 Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of. (smiles) You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can It betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?	JACK	 (admits it) The worst. (beat) On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate.	WILL	 Let's get out of here.	ELIZABETH	 You're all right!	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
NORRINGTON	 ...and though I do say so with regret, the law is clear. The penalty for piracy is death by hanging.	SWANN	 By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy. (a glance at Elizabeth) It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire   to do good, at great personal risk. It   seems to me, that in the rare occasion   where the right course is committing an   act of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the right course! (cheers of approval) So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend to grant a pardon to --	GILLETTE	 Sir!	GILLETTE (CONT'D)	 Jack and his crew have escaped! (gasps from the crowd) There was no damage to the cell ... they must have been set free.	Pirates-of-the-Caribbean
