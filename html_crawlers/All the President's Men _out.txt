WOODWARD	 You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?	ROSENFELD	 As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly. (chomps on some Maalox tablets) Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters-- (WOODWARD is surprised-- he hadn't known) --and (b) these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying-- (consults a piece of paper) --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices. (puts paper down) Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.	WOODWARD	 Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?

CADDY	 --I'm not here.	WOODWARD	 (nods) OK.	WOODWARD	 Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.			All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.	CADDY	 (impatiently) Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record. (indicating unshaven man) Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 (moving in behind him) Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.	CADDY	 Look, I told you inside--	WOODWARD	 --you have nothing more to say, I understand that.			All the President's Men 
CADDY	 So?	WOODWARD	 Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call. (looks at CADDY) So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?	CADDY	 (turning) There is no reason to assume other people were involved.	WOODWARD	 Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.	CADDY	 (turning back) They are not my clients.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.	CADDY	 (turning back) They are not my clients.

WOODWARD	 That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.	ROSENFELD	 Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt? (crunches tablets) It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.	SIMONS	 Anything?	ROSENFELD	 Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--	All the President's Men 
SIMONS	 --in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.	ROSENFELD	 (shrugs) Could develop.	SIMONS	 Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.	ROSENFELD	 OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.	All the President's Men 
ROSENFELD	 Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?	WOODWARD	 (getting it straight) The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?	ROSENFELD	 (hasn't the foggiest) Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing. (reads) "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent.

ROSENFELD	 (stops dead) I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"	WOODWARD	 Who's Colson, Harry?	ROSENFELD	 The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.	All the President's Men 
ROSENFELD	 The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.	WOODWARD	 (rising) Thanks, Harry. (looks at ROSENFELD) Know anything about Colson?	ROSENFELD	 Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."			All the President's Men

WOODWARD	 I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?	HUNT (V.O.)	 (blind panic) Good God!	WOODWARD	 I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett, but we're doing some investigating of one of your employees, Howard Hunt.	BENNETT (V.O.)	 Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the C.I.A.	All the President's Men 
BENNETT (V.O.)	 Well, if you've been doing some investigating then obviously it's no secret to you that Howard was with the C.I.A.	WOODWARD	 (he hadn't known) No secret at all.

Woodward, of the Washington Post--get me Personnel--	WOODWARD	 Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post--and--what's that?--you've never heard of me?--I can't help that--you don't believe I'm with the Post?-- what do you want me to do, Madam, shout "extra--extra"?	All the President's Men 
ROSENFELD	 Whaddya got, whaddya got?	WOODWARD	 Hunt is Colson's man-- (to SIMONS, explaining) --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel-- (SIMONS almost says something, decides against it) --they both went to Brown University-- (consulting his notes) --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.	SIMONS	 What else have you got?	WOODWARD	 According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me. (reading) "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."

(WOODWARD nods, BERNSTEIN sits down) Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.	WOODWARD	 It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.

BERNSTEIN	 Let me lay a little theory on you--	WOODWARD	 (cutting him off) --I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.	BERNSTEIN	 Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.	WOODWARD	 And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention. (to BERNSTEIN) The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.

OPERATOR (V.O.)	 One moment.	LIBRARIAN (V.O.)	 (elderly-sounding lady) Library.	BERNSTEIN	 Hi. Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. I was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy.	LIBRARIAN (V.O.)	 I think I do remember, he took out a whole bunch of material. Let me just go see.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Yes, ma'am.	LIBRARIAN (V.O.)	 What I said before? I was wrong. The truth is, I don't have a card that Mr. Hunt took out any Kennedy material. (WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN listen, and now there is something in her voice that wasn't there before: fear) I remember getting that material out for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt. The truth is, I've never had any requests at all from Mr. Hunt. (beat) The truth is, I don't know Mr. Hunt.					All the President's Men 
YOUNG CLERK	 You want every request since when?	BERNSTEIN	 (to WOODWARD) When did Hunt start at the White House?	WOODWARD	 July of '71.	BERNSTEIN	 About the past year.	All the President's Men

BRADLEE	 How senior?	WOODWARD	 (edgy) You asking me to disclose my source?	BRADLEE	 Just tell me his title.	WOODWARD	 I don't know titles.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.	DEEP THROAT	 You thought I'd help out on specifics? (headshake) I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all. (looks at WOODWARD) Are you guys really working? (WOODWARD nods) How much?	WOODWARD	 I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.	DEEP THROAT	 Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?	DEEP THROAT	 Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. (inhales) You come up with anything?	WOODWARD	 John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.

(grabbing a big manila envelope) See? (hands it to her)	HANNAH	 (looks inside) Carl, it's a jungle. (sits at his desk, takes out a mass of papers--glancing at the top bill) I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles. (studies another bill) You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.	All the President's Men

(looking at the bills) Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this. (sighs) How much did the damn bike cost?	All the President's Men

HANNAH	 (looking at paper) You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Five hundred; six maybe.	HANNAH	 (looking at paper) You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?	BERNSTEIN	 I think.	HANNAH	 Give me your checkbook then.	All the President's Men 
HANNAH	 You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?	BERNSTEIN	 Nobody's perfect. (more rubbing now) I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.	HANNAH	 Aw baby, you can get it up... I just wonder if you'll ever be able to get it together.			All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Hi, it's me. I'm still here.	SECRETARY	 (couldn't be nicer) I'm so glad.	BERNSTEIN	 I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.	SECRETARY	 And you will. (smiles) But not now.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.	SECRETARY	 And you will. (smiles) But not now.	BERNSTEIN	 I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.	SECRETARY	 I told you, he had to go out on a case.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?	SECRETARY	 He is not in the car. (Smiles; she's just so understanding) Sorry.					All the President's Men 
SECRETARY	 Well of course.	BERNSTEIN	 (quietly) Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 (to DARDIS) Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.	DARDIS	 Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?	BERNSTEIN	 (headshake) I'm on deadline.			All the President's Men 
DARDIS	 Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?	BERNSTEIN	 (headshake) I'm on deadline.					All the President's Men 
DARDIS	 I'll never get out of here in time.	BERNSTEIN	 (flying through what he's been handed) The telephone calls... we know about that.	DARDIS	 The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--	BERNSTEIN	 --yeah, that was in The Times this morning.	All the President's Men 
DARDIS	 I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was. (watching BERNSTEIN) Think it might be anything?	BERNSTEIN	 (casually) This? (shrugs) Naw...	ZOOM TO:		BERNSTEIN	 --Woodward--Woodward, listen, I don't know what I got-- (holding the Dahlberg facsimile) --and I think the Times has it too-- (big) --but somewhere there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg in this world and we've gotta find him--	All the President's Men

RESEARCHER	 Were you after the Dahlberg articles from the files? (WOODWARD nods) There aren't any, sorry.	WOODWARD	 Whazzis?	RESEARCHER	 (shrugs) Our Dahlberg file.			All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Whazzis?	RESEARCHER	 (shrugs) Our Dahlberg file.					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 --this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in-- (pause) --and I was kind of curious about your check.	DAHLBERG (V.O.)	 ...check...?	WOODWARD	 The twenty-five thousand dollar one. (silence) The one with your name on it. (silence) In Bernard Barker's Florida account. (still nothing) Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--			All the President's Men 
DAHLBERG (V.O.)	 ...check...?	WOODWARD	 The twenty-five thousand dollar one. (silence) The one with your name on it. (silence) In Bernard Barker's Florida account.

I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. (WOODWARD waits, pen ready; tense as hell) I know I shouldn't tell you this...	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Yes, sir.	DAHLBERG (V.O.)	 I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper. (WOODWARD waits, pen ready; tense as hell) I know I shouldn't tell you this...	DAHLBERG (V.O.)	 That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.	WOODWARD	 I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?	All the President's Men 
DAHLBERG (V.O.)	 I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.	WOODWARD	 (trying to keep his voice level) That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.					All the President's Men 
NATIONAL EDITOR	 --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--	ROSENFELD	 (to NATIONAL EDITOR) --quit equivocating, say what you mean-- (to SIMONS and BRADLEE) --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--	BRADLEE	 --and we printed that, didn't we, Harry? And when the frigging audit's done, we'll print that too--	NATIONAL EDITOR	 --let me tell what happened when I was having lunch today at the Sans Souci--	All the President's Men 
NATIONAL EDITOR	 --well, what if your boys get it wrong--	BRADLEE	 (after a beat) Then it's our asses, isn't it?	SIMONS	 (indicates the meeting is over) And we'll all have to go to work for a living.

(BRADLEE and SIMONS look at him) I don't think we should cover the story, period.	BRADLEE	 Go on.	FOREIGN EDITOR	 It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.	All the President's Men 
BRADLEE	 You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?	FOREIGN EDITOR	 The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one. (rises, starts out) Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.					All the President's Men 
UNION GUY	 (to another UNION GUY who's reading over his shoulder) What'd'ya think?	SECOND UNION GUY	 Politics as usual, someone just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, that's all.	UNION GUY	 (he's not so sure) Big fuckin' cookie jar.			All the President's Men 
SECOND UNION GUY	 Politics as usual, someone just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, that's all.	UNION GUY	 (he's not so sure) Big fuckin' cookie jar.					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 (sits across) This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.	JANE	 Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--	BERNSTEIN	 --you don't really think you're being followed?			All the President's Men 
JANE	 I don't know what they'd do to me.	BERNSTEIN	 (reaching over) Hey, easy...	JANE	 (headshake) We're a long way from high school, Carl... (she looks at him) ...and I'm scared.			All the President's Men

FIRST MAID	 We'll be back after lunch.	BLACK MAN	 (it's the voice from the phone) We'll be here.	SECOND MAID	 I think they went out.	WOODWARD	 (shrugs) I don't mind waiting.	All the President's Men 
SECOND MAID	 I think they went out.	WOODWARD	 (shrugs) I don't mind waiting.					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 (as WOODWARD reaches him) See her? (WOODWARD nods) Get anything?	WOODWARD	 For the paper, no; for us, plenty. (The two of them head for the terminal) I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.	BERNSTEIN	 And?--And?--	WOODWARD	 (looks at BERNSTEIN) --she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 And?--And?--	WOODWARD	 (looks at BERNSTEIN) --she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.	BERNSTEIN	 Were you eyebrow reading?

BERNSTEIN	 I don't get it... this really was my turf...	WOODWARD	 (concentrating on the map) You're not a kid anymore.	BERNSTEIN	 (shaking his head) My first day as a copy boy I was sixteen and wearing my only grown-up suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "My God, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? If it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow." (WOODWARD is getting interested in the story now) And I said, "Am I supposed to do that?" and he said, "Absolutely, it's crucial." So I run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. I'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "What the fuck do you think you're doing?" And I said, "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon paper." (BERNSTEIN looks at	WOODWARD)	 Just wanted you to know I've done dumber things than get us lost, that's all.	All the President's Men

WHOLE SERIES OF FACES		MIDDLE-AGED MAN	 (literally trembling) God, it's just so awful--					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 You had the Mighty Mo and the fries without gravy, right? (WOODWARD shrugs)	WOODWARD	 This is terrific work, if you like rejection.	BERNSTEIN	 I never scared anyone before.			All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 I never scared anyone before.	WOODWARD	 It's not us, they were scared before we got there. (looks at BERNSTEIN) What do we know?	BERNSTEIN	 Facts or theory?	WOODWARD	 Anything you've got.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 We appreciate your position--really.	WOMAN	 You people--you think that you can come into someone's life, squeeze what you want, then get out. (to BERNSTEIN) You don't appreciate a goddamn thing, mister. (to WOODWARD) And you don't understand nothing. (voice rising) But the Committee's briefed us on you--so get the hell out of here-- (big) --do you like scaring the life out of decent people?--'cause if you don't, in the name of God--stop it!					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 And I'm a Republican.	BERNSTEIN	 (surprised, turns to	WOODWARD)	 Republican?	WOODWARD	 Sure.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and--	WOMAN	 --oh, you don't want me, you want my sister. (calls out) For you.					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.	BOOKKEEPER	 (tense) I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.	BERNSTEIN	 You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?	BOOKKEEPER	 I never worked for Sloan or Stans.	All the President's Men 
BOOKKEEPER	 I never worked for Sloan or Stans.	BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	 (out of the blue; to	BERNSTEIN)	 Would you like some coffee or anything?	BERNSTEIN	 (like a shot) Please, yes, thank you. (he looks at the	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN)	 Would you like some coffee or anything?	BERNSTEIN	 (like a shot) Please, yes, thank you. (he looks at the	BOOKKEEPER)	 Can I sit down for a minute?	BOOKKEEPER	 One minute but then--	All the President's Men 
BOOKKEEPER	 One minute but then--	BERNSTEIN	 --right, right, I've got to go. (he sits) Why did you lie just then?	BERNSTEIN	 I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?	BOOKKEEPER	 ...No... never in so many words...	All the President's Men 
BOOKKEEPER	 ...No... never in so many words...	BERNSTEIN	 (gently) It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 I'm not even going to put your name down. It's just so I can keep things straight. (beat) Start with the money, why don't you?	BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	 (returning with coffee) How do you like it?	BERNSTEIN	 Everything, please.	BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	 (going again) I won't be a minute.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Everything, please.	BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	 (going again) I won't be a minute.	BERNSTEIN	 (to the BOOKKEEPER, quietly) The General Accounting report said there was a 350 thousand cash slush fund in Stans' safe. Did you know about that from the beginning?	BOOKKEEPER	 (about to fold) There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--	All the President's Men

I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.	BOOKKEEPER	 (her words are coming faster) I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.	BERNSTEIN	 Which people?	BOOKKEEPER	 The ones who could disburse the money.	All the President's Men 
BOOKKEEPER	 There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.	BERNSTEIN	 Sloan knew which five, didn't he? (she nods)	BOOKKEEPER'S SISTER	 (back with cream and sugar) Here we are.	BOOKKEEPER	 I don't want to say anymore.	All the President's Men

You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. (more and more moved now) ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit.

WOODWARD	 Mr. Sloan?	SLOAN	 (nods) My wife told me to expect you. (softly) As you know, I haven't talked to the press.	BERNSTEIN	 We were hoping that maybe now you could.

(He starts to rise)	WOODWARD	 One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?	SLOAN	 Badly. (and now for the first time, he almost smiles) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?	SLOAN	 Badly. (and now for the first time, he almost smiles) You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.	BERNSTEIN	 Right.	SLOAN	 Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 What happens when the baby comes?	SLOAN	 We're moving. (beat) I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.	BRADLEE	 This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. (looks at them) You're certain on Mitchell?	WOODWARD	 He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--	ROSENFELD	 --you got more than one source?--	All the President's Men 
MITCHELL (V.O.)	 What does it say?	BERNSTEIN	 (starting to read) John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--	MITCHELL (V.O.)	 --jeeeeeeesus--	BERNSTEIN	 --fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--	All the President's Men 
BRADLEE	 He really made that remark about Mrs. Graham? (BERNSTEIN nods) This is a family newspaper--cut the words "her tit" and run it.	THE PRESSES OF THE POST						All the President's Men 
THE SOUTHERN CREEP P.R. MAN		CREEP P.R. MAN	 (in mid-sentence) --hearsay, innuendo, and character assassination. I can only conclude that the so-called sources of the Washington Post are a fountain of misinformation--					All the President's Men 
BRADLEE'S OFFICE		SIMONS	 (reading) Same kind of crap--	BRADLEE	 (glancing through; nods) --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.	BERNSTEIN	 What's a real denial?	All the President's Men

BERNSTEIN	 What's a real denial?	BRADLEE	 If they ever start calling us goddamn liars-- (little pause) --it's time to start circling the wagons.					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?	SIMONS	 Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? (WOODWARD pushes for the elevator) And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.	WOODWARD	 You think she wants us to ease up on the story?	SIMONS	 (shrugs) I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 You think she wants us to ease up on the story?	SIMONS	 (shrugs) I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 --I'm Woodward.	MRS. GRAHAM	 You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?" (She looks at WOODWARD) I woke up again last night with that same question. (WOODWARD says nothing, waits) Are we right on this story?	WOODWARD	 I think so.	MRS. GRAHAM	 Are you sure?	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 It may never come out.	MRS. GRAHAM	 Never? Please don't tell me never. (beat) Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.	WOODWARD	 Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.	MRS. GRAHAM	 And the underground garage one. (WOODWARD, more nervous now, nods) Would I know him?	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.	MRS. GRAHAM	 And the underground garage one. (WOODWARD, more nervous now, nods) Would I know him?	WOODWARD	 I couldn't say.	MRS. GRAHAM	 But it's possible.	All the President's Men 
MRS. GRAHAM	 But it's possible.	WOODWARD	 (throat very dry) It is.	MRS. GRAHAM	 You've never told anyone who he is? (WOODWARD shakes his head) But you'd have to tell me if I asked you. (WOODWARD nods) Tell me.	WOODWARD	 (he is dying) I would, if you really ever wanted to know.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 (throat very dry) It is.	MRS. GRAHAM	 You've never told anyone who he is? (WOODWARD shakes his head) But you'd have to tell me if I asked you. (WOODWARD nods) Tell me.

WOODWARD	 What?	BRADLEE	 I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- (to BERNSTEIN who tears in--) --you think I like being aced out?	BERNSTEIN	 --what?--	WOODWARD	 --The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 --The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--	BERNSTEIN	 --the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- (WOODWARD nods) --he say anything we don't know?--	WOODWARD	 (headshake) --just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--	BRADLEE	 --it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--	All the President's Men

BERNSTEIN	 --there's nothing new in it--	BRADLEE	 --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story-- (starts out) --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--	BERNSTEIN	 Goddamnit--	WOODWARD	 --shit--	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.	WOODWARD	 Then he's got an ax. (beat) Call him anyway.					All the President's Men 
THE UNION GUYS		FIRST UNION GUY	 Who is this Woodstein? (points to paper) Two stories on the front page.	SECOND UNION GUY	 If he can't pick a winner at Pimlico, to hell with him.			All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 --I haven't said anything--	BERNSTEIN	 --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip-- (carefully) --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.	WOODWARD	 How high up, which Republicans?	BERNSTEIN	 That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--	All the President's Men 
PULL BACK		WOODWARD	 Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two. (glancing up) Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.	BERNSTEIN	 Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."	WOODWARD	 (pointing to the thickest stacks) California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states. (whirling) Why does everything you play sound the same?	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."	WOODWARD	 (pointing to the thickest stacks) California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states. (whirling) Why does everything you play sound the same?	BERNSTEIN	 --'cause I only know four chords--			All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.	SEGRETTI	 Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe-- (to BERNSTEIN) --off the record.	BERNSTEIN	 You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.	SEGRETTI	 I didn't.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 But you know who did.	SEGRETTI	 When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know. (closes his eyes) I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?	SEGRETTI	 None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.	BERNSTEIN	 Chapin did contact you then?	All the President's Men 
SEGRETTI	 Can't help you.	BERNSTEIN	 At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking. (SEGRETTI half-smiles, nods) Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 What would you have done?	WOODWARD	 You asking would I have been one of the President's men? (beat) I would have been.					All the President's Men 
DEEP THROAT	 My turn to keep you waiting. (approaches) What's the topic for tonight?	WOODWARD	 Ratfucking.	DEEP THROAT	 In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.			All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.	DEEP THROAT	 (nods) Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.	WOODWARD	 Who?--be specific. How high up?	DEEP THROAT	 You'll have to find that out, won't you.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 What?	DEEP THROAT	 Did you change cabs? (as WOODWARD nods) It didn't work, something moved there--					All the President's Men 
DEEP THROAT	 (self-mocking) I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.	WOODWARD	 (impatiently) Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?	DEEP THROAT	 They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.	WOODWARD	 Why didn't they?--who told them not to?	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Why didn't they?--who told them not to?	DEEP THROAT	 Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? (coughs) Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.	WOODWARD	 Mitchell knew then.	DEEP THROAT	 Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--	DEEP THROAT	 (nods, bigger) --don't you miss the grand scheme too.	WOODWARD	 How grand?	DEEP THROAT	 Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.	All the President's Men 
DEEP THROAT	 Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.	WOODWARD	 (stunned) Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?					All the President's Men 
BERGER	 Do you guys know about the Canuck letter?	BERNSTEIN	 (nods, drinks) Um-hmm. (stops, looks at her) Why?	BERGER	 I just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it.			All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 (hysterical) Tell him what you just told me.	BERGER	 Just than Ken Clawsen--he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for Nixon--I had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and he told me he wrote the Canuck letter. (she looks from one of them to the other) You did want to know, didn't you?					All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 You think this was Clawsen's initiation?	WOODWARD	 Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. (beat) God knows it worked.					All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?	CLAWSEN (V.O.)	 Where? (beat) What do you mean, where?	WOODWARD	 Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--	CLAWSEN (V.O.)	 --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 --if he did it or just said he did it, God knows.	BRADLEE	 I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts. (calling out to his	SECRETARY)	 Put him on. (picks up the phone) Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid? (pause) Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled. (pause) A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken. (pause) Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.			All the President's Men 
BRADLEE	 I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts. (calling out to his	SECRETARY)	 Put him on.

(pause) A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken. (pause) Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.					All the President's Men 
BRADLEE	 --because our cocks are on the chopping block and you've got to be sure that you're not just dealing with people who hate Richard Nixon and want to get him through us. You see, I don't give a shit who's President--I really don't, it's an adversary situation between them and us and it's always gonna be. I never had a closer friend than Jack Kennedy and once I printed something that pissed him off and for seven months I didn't exist.	MAN	 You none of you know who I am, do you? (they don't) You screw me up good, you don't even know what I look like.	BRADLEE	 OK, you've had your preamble; who the hell are you?	MAN	 Glenn Sedam--you wrote about me last week, you said I was one of the guys at the Committee who was sent reports. You were wrong.	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Baldwin told the FBI it was you.	SEDAM	 Baldwin told the FBI it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name. They showed him a list and he picked me but it wasn't me, it was Gordon Liddy. (looks at the reporters) My phone hasn't stopped ringing, my wife's hysterical, my kids think I'm mixed up with the burglary, my friends don't like me around all of a sudden.					All the President's Men 
CLOSE UP--SEDAM		SEDAM	 You fucked around my life, you two. (starts off) I just wanted to say thanks.	BRADLEE	 That didn't sound to me like a non- denial denial; could you have been wrong? (they nod) You had a good source? (nod) Did he have an ax? (pause. Then another nod)	CLOSE UP--BRADLEE		All the President's Men

And watch your personal lives, who you hang around with. Someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years. (beat) Make sure it isn't our blood...	All the President's Men

WOODWARD	 --That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--	BERNSTEIN	 (ticking them off) --Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--	WOODWARD	 --we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.	SLOAN	 --I'm not your source on that--	All the President's Men 
SLOAN	 I'm not your source on that.	WOODWARD	 (taking the dust pan, helping out) --look, when the Watergate grand jury questioned you, did you name names?	SLOAN	 Of course--everything they asked--	BERNSTEIN	 --if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--	All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Nah. (squints hard) Maybe.	WOODWARD	 What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?	BERNSTEIN	 Well, we are trying to ruin his life.			All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 Well, we are trying to ruin his life.	WOODWARD	 It's nothing personal, though. (looks troubled)	BERNSTEIN	 What's the matter?	WOODWARD	 Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.	All the President's Men 
WOODWARD	 Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.	BERNSTEIN	 (nods) I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.	WOODWARD	 Maybe we are...			All the President's Men 
BERNSTEIN	 --about how all you supposed experts really blew the whole investigation--	FBI GUY	 (stung) --we didn't miss so much--	WOODWARD	 --you never knew Haldeman had control of the slush fund--	FBI GUY	 --it's all in our files--	All the President's Men 
BRADLEE	 (staring at the typed story) --I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--	SIMONS	 --Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--	ROSENFELD	 --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--			All the President's Men 
ROSENFELD	 --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--	SIMONS	 (to the reporters) --go over your sources again--	WOODWARD	 --Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--	BERNSTEIN	 --and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--	All the President's Men
