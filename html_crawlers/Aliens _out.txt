MED-TECH	 And how are we today?	RIPLEY	 (weakly) Terrible.	MED-TECH	 Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.	RIPLEY	 How long have I been on Gateway station?	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 How long was I out there?  They won't tell me anything.	BURKE	 (soothing) Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet.	RIPLEY	 How long?	BURKE	 All right.  My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years.	Aliens 
BURKE	 You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?	MED-TECH	 (shouting) Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!	4-1-5!		RIPLEY	 No...noooo!	Aliens 
MED-TECH	 Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?	RIPLEY	 (faint) No.. I've slept enough.	RIPLEY	 We made it, Jones.  We made it.			Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (voice over) Dumbshit.	BURKE	 Sorry...I've been running behind all morning.	RIPLEY	 Have they located my daughter yet?			Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Is she...?	BURKE	 (scanning) Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago. (looks at her) I'm sorry.	RIPLEY	 Amy.	BURKE	 (reading) Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Amy.	BURKE	 (reading) Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.	RIPLEY	 I promised her I'd be home for her birthday.  Her eleventh birthday.  I sure missed that one. (pause) Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt.  When it came to flight schedules, anyway.	RIPLEY	 You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can.  I never can.	Aliens

You don't want to be late.	Aliens

VAN LEUWEN	 Look at it from our perspective. You freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter.  A rather expensive piece of hardware...	INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR	 (dryly) Forty-two million in adjusted dollars. That's minus payload, of course.	VAN LEUWEN	 The shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account.  That the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time.  That repairs were made.  That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct.  By you.  For reasons unknown.	RIPLEY	 Look, I told you...	Aliens 
VAN LEUWEN	 The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...	RIPLEY	 (losing it) That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! (pause) Like I said.	INSURANCE MAN	 (to ECA Rep) Are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on LV-426?	ECA REP	 No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous life larger than a simple virus.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (losing it) That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! (pause) Like I said.	INSURANCE MAN	 (to ECA Rep) Are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on LV-426?	ECA REP	 No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous life larger than a simple virus.	RIPLEY	 I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon...	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon...	ECA REP	 To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words... (read from Ripley's statement) ...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.'	RIPLEY	 Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...	VAN LEUWEN	 Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...	Aliens 
VAN LEUWEN	 Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...	RIPLEY	 (louder, stepping on him) ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...	VAN LEUWEN	 Thank you, that will be all.	RIPLEY	 That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.	BURKE	 (cheerfully) You are a head case.  Have a donut.					Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (insistent) Why won't you check out LV-426?	VAN LEUWEN	 (condescendingly) Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.	RIPLEY	 What are you talking about. What people?	VAN LEUWEN	 Terraformers...planet engineers. It's what we call a shake 'n' bake colony.  They set up atmosphere processors to make the air breathable...big job.  Takes decades.  They've already been there over twenty years.  Peacefully.	Aliens 
VAN LEUWEN	 Sixty, maybe seventy families.	RIPLEY	 (low) Sweet Jesus.					Aliens 
JORDEN	 (gloating cackle) Look at this fat, juicy magnetic profile.  And it's mine, mine, mine.	ANNE	 Half mine, dear.	NEWT	 And half mine!			Aliens 
NEWT	 Mom.  All the kids play it...	JORDEN	 (reverently) Holy shiiit!	JORDEN	 Folks, we have scored big this time.			Aliens 
JORDEN	 Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.	ANNE	 (nervous) How about 'big weird thing'?					Aliens 
NEWT	 Timmy...they've been gone a long time.	TIM	 (quavering) It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows what he's doing.	ANNE	 Mayday!  Mayday!  This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control. Repeat.  This is...			Aliens 
VOICE FROM VIDEO	 (o.s.) Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the family are heading off for the colonies!	BON	 (o.s.) Best decision I ever made, Bill. We'll be starting a new life from scratch, in a clean world. No crime.  No unemployment...					Aliens 
BURKE	 These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?	GORMAN	 (cool) We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.	RIPLEY	 (to Burke) What about you?  What's your interest in this?	BURKE	 Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'	Aliens 
GORMAN	 (cool) We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.	RIPLEY	 (to Burke) What about you?  What's your interest in this?	BURKE	 Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'	RIPLEY	 Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.	Aliens 
BURKE	 I heard you were working in the cargo docks.	RIPLEY	 (defensive) That's right.	BURKE	 Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?	RIPLEY	 (shrugging) It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.	Aliens 
BURKE	 Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?	RIPLEY	 (shrugging) It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.	BURKE	 What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?	RIPLEY	 If I go.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 If I go.	BURKE	 If you go. (pause) It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...	RIPLEY	 (frosty) Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.	BURKE	 Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...	Aliens

BURKE	 Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...	RIPLEY	 (shouting) No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.	BURKE	 Think about it.			Aliens 
BURKE	 (on video phone) Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...	RIPLEY	 Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.	BURKE	 That's the plan.  My word on it.			Aliens 
FROST	 Hey, hand job, you take my towel?	SPUNKMEYER	 (overlapping) I need some slack, man.  How come they send us straight back out like this?  We got some slack comin', man.	HICKS	 You just got three weeks.	SPUNKMEYER	 I mean breathing, not this frozen shit.	Aliens 
DIETRICH	 Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?	APONE	 You know it ain't up to me. (louder) Awright!  Let's knock off the grabass.  First assembly's in fifteen...let's shag it.					Aliens 
VASQUEZ	 Who's the fresh meat again?	FERRO	 She's supposed to be some kinda consultant... (exaggerated) ...She was an alien once.	HUDSON	 Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.	APONE	 Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!	Aliens 
WIERZBOWSKI	 Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't mind getting me some more a that Arcturan poontang.  Remember that time?	HICKS	 (low) Looks like that new Lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts.	WIERZBOWSKI	 (glancing over shoulder) Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass, definitely.	BISHOP	 I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley.	Aliens 
HICKS	 (low) Looks like that new Lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts.	WIERZBOWSKI	 (glancing over shoulder) Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass, definitely.	BISHOP	 I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley.	RIPLEY	 You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?	Aliens 
BURKE	 Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.	BISHOP	 Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being. (smiling) More cornbread?	RIPLEY	 Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight?	WIERZBOWSKI	 She don't like the cornbread either.	Aliens 
HUDSON	 Sir?	GORMAN	 (annoyed) Yes, Hicks?	HUDSON	 Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.	GORMAN	 What's the question?	Aliens 
WIERZBOWSKI	 A what?	HICKS	 (to Wierzbowski; low) It's a bug-hunt. (louder) So what are these things?	RIPLEY	 I've dictated what I know on these.	APONE	 Tease us a bit.	Aliens 
HUDSON	 Sounds like you, Hicks.	RIPLEY	 (controlled) The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it... (with difficulty) ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --	VASQUEZ	 I only need to know one thing.	RIPLEY	 Yes?	Aliens 
HUDSON	 Anytime.  Anywhere.	RIPLEY	 (icy) Am I disturbing you conversation Mr. Hudson?	RIPLEY	 I hope you're right.  I really do.	BURKE	 (to all) I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 I hope you're right.  I really do.	BURKE	 (to all) I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.	GORMAN	 Are there any questions?  Hudson?	HUDSON	 How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?	Aliens 
HUDSON	 How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?	GORMAN	 All right.  I want this to go smooth and by the numbers.  I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830. (some groans) Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours...					Aliens 
APONE	 I don't know.  Is there anything you can do?	RIPLEY	 (pointing) I can drive that loader.  I've got a Class Two rating.  My latest career move.					Aliens 
FERRO	 (icy calm) Switching to DCS ranging.	SPUNKMEYER	 Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile. Picking up some hull ionization.	FERRO	 Got it.  Rough air ahead.			Aliens 
FERRO	 (voice over; filtered) Stand by for some chop.	RIPLEY	 How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?	GORMAN	 Thirty-eight...simulated.			Aliens

GORMAN	 Where are your parents?  You have to try...	RIPLEY	 (sharply) Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.	GORMAN	 Total brain-lock.	DIETRICH	 (shrugs) Physically she's okay. Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think any permanent damage.	Aliens 
GORMAN	 Total brain-lock.	DIETRICH	 (shrugs) Physically she's okay. Borderline malnutrition, but I don't think any permanent damage.	GORMAN	 Come on, we're wasting our time.	RIPLEY	 Here, try this.  A little instant hot chocolate.	Aliens

RIPLEY	 That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.	BURKE	 (realizing) She's right.	GORMAN	 So.	RIPLEY	 So...then the fusion containment shuts down.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 So...then the fusion containment shuts down.	GORMAN	 (impatient) So?  So?	BURKE	 We're talking thermonuclear explosion.	GORMAN	 Shit. (into mike) Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.	Aliens

HUDSON	 Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?	RIPLEY	 (to Vasquez) No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.	BURKE	 Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.	RIPLEY	 Why not?	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 You son of a bitch.	BURKE	 (hardening) Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.	RIPLEY	 What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.	BURKE	 Corporal Hicks!?	Aliens

NEWT	 You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.	HUDSON	 (kicking rocks) Just tell me what the fuck we're supposed to do now.  What're we gonna do now?

HICKS	 We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.	RIPLEY	 That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... (pointing) ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.	HICKS	 Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.

NEWT	 My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.	RIPLEY	 (quietly) Yes, there are, aren't there.	NEWT	 Why do they tell little kids that?	RIPLEY	 Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Aliens 
NEWT	 Where is she?	RIPLEY	 (quietly) Gone.	NEWT	 You mean dead.	NEWT	 Ripley, I was just thinking... Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her.  Just for a while.  You can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. I'll understand.  No big deal. Whattya think?	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (voice over) How is he?	BISHOP	 I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.	RIPLEY	 Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...			Aliens 
BISHOP	 Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.	RIPLEY	 (rising) I want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. You understand?	BISHOP	 Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.  He was very specific.	RIPLEY	 Burke!	Aliens 
BURKE	 Now, wait a second --	RIPLEY	 (stepping on him) You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.	RIPLEY	 You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?	BURKE	 Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Bad call?  These people are fucking dead, Burke!  Well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and I'll be there when they do.	BURKE	 (sadly) I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.	RIPLEY	 Sorry to disappoint you.			Aliens 
HUDSON	 Man, listen to that.	BISHOP	 (voice over) Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have some bad news.	HUDSON	 Well, that's a switch.			Aliens 
VASQUEZ	 Hudson, give us a break.	RIPLEY	 (to Hicks) We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.	HUDSON	 How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.	RIPLEY	 (pacing) I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.	Aliens 
HUDSON	 How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.	RIPLEY	 (pacing) I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.	HUDSON	 Think of what?  We're fucked.	RIPLEY	 What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?	Aliens 
HUDSON	 Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.	BISHOP	 (quietly) I'll go.	RIPLEY	 What?	BISHOP	 I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	BISHOP	 (cheerfully) See you soon.					Aliens 
HICKS	 (voice over) They're in the approach corridor.	RIPLEY	 (into mike) On my way.					Aliens 
HUDSON	 Maybe we got 'em demoralized.	HICKS	 (to Vasquez and Hudson) I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.	HICKS	 How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours?	RIPLEY	 (grimly) They'll get us.	Aliens 
HICKS	 How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours?	RIPLEY	 (grimly) They'll get us.	HICKS	 Maybe.  Maybe not.	RIPLEY	 Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?	Aliens 
GORMAN	 You still want to kill me?	VASQUEZ	 (turning away) It won't be necessary.					Aliens 
RIPLEY	 There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all right. EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139	BISHOP	 (to himself) Now, if I did it right...					Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (whispers) Newt.  Newt, wake up.	NEWT	 Wah...?  Where are...?	RIPLEY	 (whispers) Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.			Aliens 
NEWT	 Wah...?  Where are...?	RIPLEY	 (whispers) Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.	RIPLEY	 (shouting) Hey...hey!	RIPLEY	 Hicks!  Hicks!	Aliens 
HICKS	 (into mike) Roger.  Check back when you've activated the ship. (turning) He's at the up-link tower.	BURKE	 (calmly) Excellent.					Aliens 
HUDSON	 Do it!	RIPLEY	 (coughing) Burke...it was Burke.					Aliens 
HUDSON	 (intense) I say we grease this rat-fuck son of a bitch right now!	HICKS	 (pacing) I don't get it.  It doesn't make any Goddamn sense.	RIPLEY	 He wanted an alien, only he couldn't get it back through quarantine.  But if we were impregnated ...whatever you call it...and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time...then nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt.	HICKS	 Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.	HUDSON	 Fuuuck!  He's dead. (to Burke) You're dogmeat, pal.	BURKE	 This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful.	RIPLEY	 (wearily) You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.	Aliens 
BURKE	 This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful.	RIPLEY	 (wearily) You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.	HICKS	 (serious) Let's waste him. (to Burke) No offense.	RIPLEY	 Just find someplace to lock him up until it's time to --	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (wearily) You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.	HICKS	 (serious) Let's waste him. (to Burke) No offense.	RIPLEY	 Just find someplace to lock him up until it's time to --	RIPLEY	 They cut the power.	Aliens 
HUDSON	 What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.	RIPLEY	 Newt!  Stay close. (to the others) Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch Burke.					Aliens 
RIPLEY	 (voice over) Anything?	HUDSON	 There's something.	HUDSON	 It's inside the complex.			Aliens 
HUDSON	 It's inside the complex.	VASQUEZ	 (voice over) You're just reading me.	HUDSON	 No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.	RIPLEY	 Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?	VASQUEZ	 (cool) Hudson may be right.					Aliens 
HICKS	 (low) It's game time.	RIPLEY	 Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.					Aliens 
HUDSON	 This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...	RIPLEY	 (voice over) Just get back here!					Aliens 
HUDSON	 Range twenty meters.	RIPLEY	 (to Vasquez) Seal the door.	HUDSON	 Seventeen meters.	HICKS	 Let's get these things lit.	Aliens 
HUDSON	 (hysterical) Let's go!  Let's go!	HICKS	 Fuckin' A!					Aliens 
HICKS	 (o.s.) Hold you fire!	RIPLEY	 (indicating door) Locked.	HICKS	 Stand back.	GORMAN	 You can't use those in here!	Aliens 
VASQUEZ	 Right.  Fire in the hole!	HICKS	 (shouting at Vasquez) Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.	VASQUEZ	 (shouting) What?			Aliens 
HICKS	 (shouting at Vasquez) Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.	VASQUEZ	 (shouting) What?					Aliens 
NEWT	 Go right.	HICKS	 (into headset) Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.	BISHOP	 (voice over; static) Yes, I read you.  Not very well...			Aliens 
HICKS	 (into headset) Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.	BISHOP	 (voice over; static) Yes, I read you.  Not very well...					Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Back.  Go back!	VASQUEZ	 (icy) Losing fuel.	VASQUEZ	 (hoarse whisper) You always were an asshole, Gorman.			Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Newt!	NEWT	 (o.s.) Mommy...where are you?	NEWT	 (o.s.) Moooommeeee...	RIPLEY	 (to her headset) Hicks, get down here.  I need that locator.	Aliens 
NEWT	 (o.s.) Moooommeeee...	RIPLEY	 (to her headset) Hicks, get down here.  I need that locator.					Aliens 
RIPLEY	 No!  Noooo!	HICKS	 (intense) She's gone!  Let's go!	RIPLEY	 No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --	HICKS	 All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Hicks, don't let him leave.	HICKS	 (grimacing with pain) We ain't going anywhere.	RIPLEY	 See you, Hicks.	HICKS	 Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.	Aliens 
RIPLEY	 Ellen.	HICKS	 (nods with satisfaction) Don't be long, Ellen.					Aliens 
NEWT	 (weakly) I knew you'd come.	RIPLEY	 Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.					Aliens 
BISHOP!		RIPLEY	 (to Newt; low) Close your eyes, baby.	VOICE	 You now have thirty seconds to reach...			Aliens 
BISHOP	 Well, thanks, I --	RIPLEY	 (to Newt) Go!	RIPLEY	 Here!			Aliens 
BISHOP	 Not bad for a human.	NEWT	 (weakly) Mommy...Mommy?	RIPLEY	 Right here, baby.  Right here.			Aliens
