DESK SERGEANT	 Briefing room. Down that hall...third door on the left. INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING (acknowledging) Good Morning, Doctor.	SWEENEY	 Good morning.	RASMUSSEN	 Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney. He's Principal over at Venice High and for some time now he's done a load of outreach work with gangs...in and out of the can.			American History X 
RASMUSSEN	 Cammeron Alexander is probably the biggest writer and distributor of white power literature in LA County. He promotes white power bands, writes reviews, columns, all at the ripe age of forty.	YOUNG COP	 (smiling) He's forty? Jesus.	RASMUSSEN	 Pretty clean record...runs everything out of his house down by the beach.	SWEENEY	 There weren't any organized white gangs around Venice before those two hooked up. Very few, if any. It was mostly just black and Mexican. But it was tiny. They hit it off though... and Alexander hit the jackpot with Derek.	American History X 
REPORTER	 Earlier this evening...LA County Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot and killed while putting out a fire in a suspected Compton drug den.	RASMUSSEN	 (to the group) This being February of '90.					American History X 
REPORTER	 To my right I have Lieutenant Vinyard's oldest son Derek. (to Derek) How do you feel about all this, son?	DEREK	 How do I feel? How do you think I feel? It's typical.	REPORTER	 Typical how, Derek?			American History X 
REPORTER	 So you're saying the murder of your father is "race" related?	DEREK	 Every problem in this country is "race" related. Every problem, not just crime. These problems are rooted in the black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian...every non- Protestant group in our society. (then) Look at the shit. Immigration... welfare...AIDS...they're all the problems of the non-white. Look at the statistics.	REPORTER	 Most of these issues you're referring to though son are related to--	DEREK	 (interrupting) No no no! Don't say poverty right now cause that's not it. They're not a product of our fucking environment either! Minorities don't give two shits about this country! They're here to exploit...not embrace.	American History X

They're not a product of our fucking environment either! Minorities don't give two shits about this country! They're here to exploit...not embrace.	RASMUSSEN (O.S)	 (over reporter's question) When Alexander got his hands on this segment...he copied it, sent it out and it became the Gettysberg Address for hate groups across the country.	DEREK	 Millions of white Europeans came to this country and flourished within a generation! A generation! So what the fuck is wrong with these people?!	American History X

REPORTER	 What does any of this have to do with your father?	American History X 
RASMUSSEN	 It's not exactly LAPD policy but I want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard for a few days.	COP #2	 (smiling in disbelief) Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?	RASMUSSEN	 Just for a few days.	ANOTHER COP	 He doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here, Captain. You want us to bust him or protect him?	American History X

DANNY	 Let us get on with our lives, man!	SWEENEY	 Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he can take care of himself.  I'm worried about his little brother. (softly) Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!	DANNY	 Do it. What?  You don't think I could handle it?	SWEENEY	 (smiling in disbelief) The street would kill you, Danny. You're not tough. The second a brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll be holierin' for Doris. (pondering to himself) So here's the drill. Take it or leave it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm your history teacher from here on out. We're gonna deal with shit happening right now. Call it American History...X. I see your ass once a day. Any more, any less, and you're a memory at Venice High. Clear?	American History X

BLACK WOMAN	 (fed up, to the camera) They've done it to us again.	SETH	 Nigger lovin' Jew media calling the shots. Watch cartoons. It's the only t.v. that's safe nowadays.	DORIS	 No one's safe--until we all are.			American History X 
DANNY	 Because they're a burden to the advancement of the white race.  Some of them are all right--	SETH	 None of them are all right, Danny. They're all a bunch of fucking freeloaders. (after a beat) Remermber Canuneron. "We don't know them, we don't want to know them, they're the fucking enemy." What don't you like about them?	DANNY	 I don't know.  I feel threatened by them.	DAVINA	 They feel threatened by you!	American History X 
DAVINA	 They feel threatened by you!	SETH	 (ignoring her) What else, Danny? And speak intelligently you little queer faggot.	DANNY	 I hate the fact that it's cool to be black these days.	DANNY	 I hate this hip hop influence on white fuckin' suburbia.	American History X 
DAVINA	 You shut up, you poison to fuckin' society! Get out of our house!	SETH	 (laughing) Is this any way to treat a guest?	DAVINA	 Derek hates you, Seth.	DEREK (O.S.)	 How do you know who I hate, Davina?	American History X

DORIS	 I need a cigarette.	DEREK	 My ass. You smoke two packs a day. That's why you're spittin' phlegm. (astonished) Jesus, Mrs. Vinyard.  I think a lung just came up.	DORIS	 I'm high as a kite.	DANNY	 You got any more?	American History X

CAMMERON	 Somebody needs to drive, Derek.	DEREK	 (referring to his mouth) All right. You can turn it off now. (back to Stacey) You're right on his tail, right?	STACEY	 (nodding) I hate that fucking Korean.  I hope you smash his face in.	DEREK	 Just be ready, okay?	American History X 
DEREK	 (referring to his mouth) All right. You can turn it off now. (back to Stacey) You're right on his tail, right?	STACEY	 (nodding) I hate that fucking Korean.  I hope you smash his face in.	DEREK	 Just be ready, okay?	DEREK	 Come on. Let's pull it together. Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games here. Let's go.	American History X 
CURTIS	 Okay. Jesus.	DEREK	 (to the group) We're here tonight cause we got immigration problems spiralling out of control. We got Asians up the ass... taking over our land with their fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into this place like some giant fucking Pinata was shattered.	DEREK	 Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the Statue of Liberty it says "Give me your tired, your hungry, your poor, your huddled masses...yearning to be free." It does not say give me your shiftless, your greedy, your indolent, your criminals, looking for a free ticket.	DEREK	 We're here tonight to show the government how we feel about minorities taking over our country. The treat us like criminals while they reward them with jobs and fucking welfare checks. And it's only getting worse.	American History X

SETH	 Wheto's your fucking green card, asshole?	DEREK	 (referring to the border) Can't hide from me, motherfucker!					American History X 
MURRAY	 No.  You guys make bombs.	DEREK	 You're so fucking lame. A couple of cranks in cabins in Montana is not statistically significant. (then) White Americans don't take PCP and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over and trust the law.	MURRAY	 You're kidding, right?	DAVINA	 (sarcastically) Don't you know, Murray? White people never break the law. We're perfect little angels.	American History X 
MURRAY	 You're kidding, right?	DAVINA	 (sarcastically) Don't you know, Murray? White people never break the law. We're perfect little angels.	DEREK	 That's not what I said, Davina. (to the group) Three different times Rodney King comes at those officers with the intent to hurt them. To hurt them! Three times! But since we see it on some fucking tampered videotape...the bleeding heart media makes you believe that he only comes at them once. All we see is Powell, Koon and Wind hittin' him and-- (busting up laughing) Briseno kickin' him in the back of the fuckin' skull with his boot. Still, the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and kick their asses! That's how stupid that motherfucker is. Those cops used textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were still here he'd say the same damn thing.	DORIS	 That doesn't make it right.	American History X

DORIS	 That doesn't make it right.	DEREK	 Yes it does. Yes it does. They're cops! They are taught to use that stick and they did.	American History X 
MURRAY	 What the hell does that have to do with anything?	DORIS	 (to Derek) You know...sometimes it's hard to believe I gave birth to you.	DEREK	 Give thanks to the food on the table and then believe it, Doris.	DORIS	 We both put food on this table, fella.	American History X 
DORIS	 Can we forget about Rodney King for chrissake?!	DEREK	 (fiercely continuing) --while hopped up on Chivas and P.C.P...you'd consider the force those cops used to be justified!	DORIS	 He didn't hit anybody!	DEREK	 If he did though! If that shithead killed Dan...you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would everybody else. But since he didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across America" for the son of a bitch.	American History X 
STACEY	 Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece of garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls over in front of a perfectly lighted area where a video camera is sitting there...fucking waiting for him, man. What happens next? Chief Gates is dust. It's total--	DAVINA	 (to Doris) May I be excused please?	DEREK	 Don't interrupt, Davina.	DAVINA	 I didn't interrupt shit.	American History X 
DAVI NA	 Let go of my fucking hair!	DEREK	 (to Murray) See! See the way she speaks! Tell me you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.	DORIS	 Derek!  Let go of her hair and sit down!	DEREK	 I will when I hear an answer, Doris. Are you going to shut up, Davina?	American History X 
MURRAY	 She can't breathe, Derek!	DEREK	 Stay back, both of you!  It's her bed, she's gotta lie in it. (grabbing harder) You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm not gonna let go until you tell me what I wanna hear! Are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of your's and let my girlfriend tell her opinion? Are you?!	DORIS	 Let go of her hair and get out.	DAVINA (O.S)	 I hate you, you fucking asshole!	American History X 
DEREK	 You okay?	MURRAY	 (softly) Psycho.					American History X 
DEREK	 Would you care to repeat that, Murray? I'm not sure I got all of it.	STACEY	 (smiling) He called you a "psycho", honey.	DEREK	 (smiling back) Was that it?    Thanks Murray.	MURRAY	 See. Here we go again with this, Derek. Making me out to be the bad guy again.	American History X 
STACEY	 (smiling) He called you a "psycho", honey.	DEREK	 (smiling back) Was that it?    Thanks Murray.	MURRAY	 See. Here we go again with this, Derek. Making me out to be the bad guy again.	STACEY	 You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?	American History X 
STACEY	 You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?	MURRAY	 (to Stacey) Hey goddammit! You talk to me with respect or--!	DEREK	 Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna do? Give her fucking detention?	DORIS	 Both of you get out right now.	American History X 
DAVINA	 Fuck you! Let go!	DEREK	 (whispering in her ear) I'm sorry, Davina. Come on.	DAVINA	 Let go of me!	DEREK	 Come on, Davina.  I'm sorry. I lost control. Please.  I screwed up.	American History X 
DEREK	 (hugging Davina) You guys are my life and I'd do anything for you. You do know that?	DAVINA	 (wiping her tears) I don't believe you anymore.	DEREK	 I swear to God I would, Davina. Please.	DANNY	 I believe you, Der.	American History X 
DEREK	 Davina? Please forgive me.  Please. I'm sorry.	DAVINA	 (nodding, after a beat) That fuckin' sucked, Derek.	DEREK	 I know it did. And I'm sorry. I just really hate that guy.	DAVINA	 You couldn't tell.	American History X 
DANNY	 No. You're not.	DORIS	 (laughing) Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you ever gonna let that beautiful hair grow back?	DANNY	 Nope. Never.	DORIS	 I bet you will.	American History X 
DEREK	 What the fuck did you say?  You just threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?	DANNY	 (anticipating)	DANNY	 (crying) Holy fucking shit!  Derek!    What the hell was that for?!  Jesus!	DANNY (V/O)	 Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder is always with us. It's almost an institution." That couldn't rang more true than with me.	American History X 
DANNY	 I told you I can't tonight.	DORIS (O.S.)	 (from the couch) Danny?	DANNY	 It's okay, Mom.			American History X

CAMMERON	 Oh man.  Fucking Sweeney.	STACEY	 (chiming in) Meanwhile, niggers and spics do their reports on Malcolm X and fucking Fidel Castro.	CAMMERON	 Sweeney's got an agenda, Danny. And it's all a load of crap. You hear me? He's all about brainwashing. Don't get fucking fooled by it.	DEREK (O.S.)	 What the hell are you doing here, Dan?	American History X 
DEREK (O.S.)	 What the hell are you doing here, Dan?	CAMMERON	 (smiling) Hey. I was wondering when he was going to show his face.	DEREK	 What did I tell you, Dan?	DANNY	 I had to check it out, Der.  Come on.	American History X

DEREK	 I'm serious, Stacey!  Stay away!	STACEY	 What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit me?! Kick me as I roll on the fuckin' ground screaming?! (then) That bullshit with Cammeron is nothing, Derek!

And just like Cameron and Seth and a million others out there...I'll believe that 'til the day I fucking die. I will. Nothing will ever change that either.	American History X 
ET AL	 Forty-five! Forty-six!  Forty- seven...!	SETH	 (grabbing Danny) Why the fuck did you pump it?! I coulda gone for a minute at least!	DEREK	 Let him go, Seth.	SETH	 Where's Cameron?	American History X

LAMONT	 If your smart though you'll remember one thing. You're the nigger in here. Not me.			American History X 
SWEENEY	 Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek. Not skin color. Skin is thin. I don't get you, man.  I don't. (after a beat) I got my Doctorate in Education...not in medicine. But if you think babies come into this world evil...you're fucked up, Derek. You're way to smart to believe that shit. (then) There's nothin' more beautiful Derek, nothin' more pure, nothin' more innocent...than a baby.	DEREK	 They killed my father, Sweeney.	SWEENEY	 Jesus Derek.

DORIS	 He's doing the same stuff you were doing, Derek. Hanging out with Cammeron, getting into trouble. It brings back a lot of sad memories. And I can't do anything...he won't listen to me. He needs you.	American History X 
DEREK	 What for?	DENNIS	 A guy was shot yesterday in Inglewood...changin' a valve on a hydrant. LAPD is worried that more firefighters will become targets. That's what this bullshit is about. (sipping his coffee) A good father this guy was though and now he's in intensive care because of some goddamn--! They've pretty much declared war on LAPD and us.	DORIS	 Why you guys though? I can see them but the fire department?	DENNIS	 They think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it. So now we got two fights goin' on at one goddamn time.	American History X 
DEREK	 Sweeney actually had a pretty good take on affirmative action the other day.	DENNIS	 (smiling) Really? I didn't know you spoke "African", Derek? Where'd you learn that shit? Johannesberg?

SETH	 What do you mean?	CAMMERON	 Stevie McCormick called...old school Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin' life. He hated Derek. (exhaling) Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in there.	SETH	 (overwhelmed) Fucking A.	CAMMERON	 Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?	American History X 
CAMMERON	 Stevie McCormick called...old school Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin' life. He hated Derek. (exhaling) Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in there.	SETH	 (overwhelmed) Fucking A.	CAMMERON	 Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?	CAMMERON	 (looking at the two) Is there anything sacred in this country anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey. Stop feeding your face for a second and look behind you.	American History X 
CAMMERON	 I recommend either the "Big Ben Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special." Ben'll replace the dark meat with the white meat if you ask nicely.	BLACK MAN	 (fed up) What's your problem, pal?	CAMMERON	 I ain't your fucking pal first of all. Secondly...I don't have problems. People who luck with me have problems.	WHITE GIRL	 Come on. Let's get out of here.	American History X 
BLACK MAN	 You're not me.	CAMHERON	 (smiling) And I thank God Almighty every day for that, believe me.	SETH	 Excuse me? Tyrone?	BLACK MAN	 My name's not Tyrone either.	American History X 
BLACK MAN	 My name's not Tyrone either.	WHITE GIRL	 (disgusted) Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes come from?!	CAMMERON	 What the luck difference does it make where we come from, bitch? I'm from a place called America. A place that used to be a nice place to live before it became fuckin' Africa-America.	BLACK MAN	 You ignorant mother--	American History X 
SETH	 You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole? Do you? Make your move now if you do. If you don't...get the luck out of my sight. Cause I'm real close to shoving my piece up your girlfriend's stinky pussy.	CAMMERON	 (smiling) Everything's hunky dory, Ben!  No problemo. Only us white folk.					American History X 
SETH	 What's that?	CAMMERON	 (going mad) Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost all of those orange kid relationships are black man and white women and I'm fucking sick of seein' it! I wouldn't mind so much if it were more even.	SETH	 Huge dicks, Cam.  That's all it is.	CAMMERON	 I used to think that too but...it's gotta be more, man. It has to be more than the fact they they carry a big load. Chicks aren't that shallow, are they? It's politically correct... that's what it is. White women...bein' seen with the coloreds...it's great for their image. Bitches today want to be known as bein' fuckin' color blind.	American History X 
CAMMERON	 Well...how'd you like to drag around some fat fly girl? I wouldn't.	SETH	 No shit. (imitating) Oh go girlfriend! Don't be puttin' up wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl!					American History X 
DEREK	 We're getting out of here soon.  Is that okay with you?	DORIS	 I'd love it. (after a beat) Do you think I should color my hair?	DORIS	 I'm glad you made it back. I wasn't too sure I was going to see you again. You know how I get.	DEREK	 You think you'll be able to forgive me? Someday maybe?	American History X 
DANNY	 Maple bar and a...large milk.	DEREK	 (to the girl) You look pretty.	TISHA	 Thank you.	DEREK	 How do I look?	American History X 
DEREK	 How do I look?	BLACK GIRL	 (bashfully) Fine.	DEREK	 What's your name?	DEREK	 How old are you, Tisha?	American History X 
DEREK	 How old are you, Tisha?	BLACK MOTHER	 (staring at Derek) Come here, Tisha.	DEREK	 What's goin' on?	SWEENEY	 We need to talk, Derek.	American History X 
DEREK	 How bad?	RASMUSSEN	 They'll live. (then) They must have been looking for somebody else.	SWEENEY	 Are they coming after you?	DEREK	 Fuckin' A.	American History X 
DEREK	 Fuckin' A.	SWEENEY	 I don't know. (after a long beat) You might have to talk to your old crew though.	DEREK	 I can't, Sweeney.	SWEENEY	 Try, Derek. Okay?	American History X 
DANNY	 Jesus Christ.  What are you doing, Henry?	LITTLE HENRY	 (afraid) What does it look like I'm doin'?	DANNY	 Come on, man, no.  You don't want to do this. Come on.  Henry?	LITTLE HENRY	 (terrified) Danny?	American History X 
DANNY	 Come on, man, no.  You don't want to do this. Come on.  Henry?	LITTLE HENRY	 (terrified) Danny?	LITTLE HENRY	 Vinyard? Danny?			American History X
