MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO		AUSTIN	 (very sad) I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, my one true love, the woman who taught me the beauty of sharing your whole life with another, the person who taught me the meaning of love, was a Fembot. How will I ever go on? (beat) Wait a tic! That means I'm single! Oh, behave!					Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
DR. EVIL	 Right. Perhaps you've confused me with someone who gives a shit.  Might I remind you that I run the show here? I demand a little respect.	NUMBER TWO	 (indicating Dr. Evil's milk mustache) Dr. Evil, I think you--	DR. EVIL	 Silence! I will not tolerate your insolence! Remember what happened last time.	FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)		Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
FRAU	 Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'	DR. EVIL	 (wiping it off, embarrassed) Oh, I know. I know.	NUMBER TWO	 Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the Greek assassin, Oedipus.	DR. EVIL	 Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. Excited?	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
DR. EVIL	 Of course you do.	NUMBER TWO	 (clearing throat) Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them.	DR. EVIL	 I have so few pleasures left to me, Number Two. The key to life is to rotate your vices. One day it's executions, another day it's creamy French cheese.  It's like frickin' heroin.	NUMBER TWO	 Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you.	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
NUMBER TWO	 We had a few glitches, but I think you'll be pleased with the results.	FRAU	 (shouting) Send in the clone!	NUMBER TWO	 He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size.	DR. EVIL	 Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini- Me. (to clone) Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.

DR. EVIL	 With a White House intern!	NUMBER TWO	 (clearing his throat) Uh-hem.	DR. EVIL	 What, that already happened?	DR. EVIL	 This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, how about a frickin' time machine? Does the president have a time machine? Have I been scooped on that?	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
DR. EVIL	 No, no, no.	NUMBER TWO	 (interrupting) Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to use your knowledge of the future to play the stock market? We could literally make trillions.	DR. EVIL	 (smug laugh to himself) Why make trillions when we could make... (pause) Billions?	NUMBER TWO	 Excuse me?	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

BASIL EXPOSITION	 What's wrong with your neck, Austin?	AUSTIN	 (turning stiffly to face Basil) I took a Viagra and it got caught in my throat. I've had a stiff neck for hours. Basil, is it true? Have I lost my mojo?	BASIL EXPOSITION	 We're going to run a few tests, Austin. Don't worry, old friend, we'll get to the bottom of this.			Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
NURSE	 Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to give you a sponge bath before we begin the test.	AUSTIN	 (not paying attention to her) Alright, miss, just let me finish this article on the Suez crisis.	AUSTIN	 What's going on?	BASIL EXPOSITION	 Alright, everyone, we're done.	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
BASIL EXPOSITION	 I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo.	AUSTIN	 (crushed) Without my mojo, I'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think it's time to retire.	BASIL EXPOSITION	 I'm afraid that's not possible, Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned.	AUSTIN	 Again?	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me 
BASIL EXPOSITION	 That's what they'd like you to believe.	AUSTIN	 So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties? (goes cross-eyed) Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.	BASIL EXPOSITION	 (to camera) I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself.	AUSTIN	 This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea.	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me

FELICITY	 I've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You're the reason I became a spy. Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time.	AUSTIN	 (reflective) Felicity, I used to think that way, too, but I guess... I guess I've changed.  Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the first place, but- where was I?	MUSIC: SAD INSTRUMENTAL		AUSTIN	 Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. I've lost my mojo.	Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me
