SAYER	 I ' m sorry to wake you, but there's someone here to see you. Leonard remains still. "Asleep." And there's a long silence broken only by the sound of pages being turned. And then, from Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop" --	PAULA	 (reading) "Night is generally my time for walking. In the summer, I often leave home early in the morning and roam about fields and lanes.: ' "^             all day. Or even escape for days or weeks together . . . Leonard is unable to acknowledge in any way that he recognizes the words or her voice . . . but he does. And as she reads, the words become alive and the walls recede ...
