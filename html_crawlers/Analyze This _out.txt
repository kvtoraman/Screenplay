MANETTA	 Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of it capo de tutti capi, and that was the last time the whole commission tried to meet -- until now.	VITTI	 (brooding) I don't know. I don't like it. What do we need a meeting for? Let everybody worry about their own business.	MANETTA	 The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. This meeting is about how we're gonna survive. You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with. Everything's changing. We need a leader. Someone with fresh ideas. Someone like you. It's gonna be a new century, Paul. We gotta change with the times.	VITTI	 What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site?	Analyze This

BEN	 No really, it's all right.	JIMMY	 (pulls a gun) Get in the fucking car.	VITTI	 Do what he says.	BEN	 You know, we call this a transference neurosis. It's when the patient starts acting out his problems with his therapist instead of out in the world. It's usually considered a good sign. Not for me, in this case, but --	Analyze This 
VITTI	 (to Jimmy and Jelly) Leave us alone.	JELLY	 Sorry, Doc.    It's not personal, you know.	BEN	 Don't kid yourself, Jelly. It doesn't get more personal than this.			Analyze This

If he gets nervous and fucks up, they'll kill him for sure. (to Ben) Let's go over it again.	BEN	 This is insane.	JELLY	 Mr. Vitti's been detained, apologies all around, blah, blah, blah. Then you say you're the new consigliere, and you're prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti.	Analyze This 
JIMMY	 Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.	JELLY	 Shut up. (to Ben) If you have to talk, just be vague. Can you do that?	BEN	 I'm a psychologist.   Believe me, I can be vague.			Analyze This

I think we better start. We have a big agenda, so for now let's stick to the big issues. And it would help if you identify yourselves when you speak, since we don't all know each other, and we didn't think anybody would be into wearing any fucking name tags.	Analyze This 
SINDONE	 I'm Primo Sindone. They call me Sonny Long. It's good to see so many of the old faces here, and to welcome the new ones from all over the country. I see Frank Zello, and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a little disappointed to see that the head of our other New York family isn't here today. All I see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off little prick nobody knows.	JELLY	 (stands up, rattled) Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for -- being detained -- and he apologizes for his -- detainment.	SINDONE	 Detained? What kind of bullshit is that? What's more important than this? As the host of this meeting, I take his not being here as a sign of disrespect to me and to all these other men, too, who came a long way to be here.	JELLY	 Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect. The thing is, he's not feeling well. He's sick and he -- didn't feel well --	Analyze This
