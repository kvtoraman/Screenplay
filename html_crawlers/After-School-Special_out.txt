FRED	 First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law, then when I'm making a hundred grand a year, I'll have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht.	MATT	 (to Deacon) Will that work?	DEACON	 (to Fred) You are a complete moron.	FRED	 What?	After-School-Special
MATT	 (to Deacon) Will that work?	DEACON	 (to Fred) You are a complete moron.	FRED	 What?	DEACON (V.O.)	 Until that big payday, Fred's sex life consists of spanking it.	After-School-Special
DEACON (V.O.)	 Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex.	BIOLOGY TEACHER	 (in the background) ... the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male...	DEACON (V.O.)	 We're suffering. Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode.	GUY 1	 Did you hear about Rachael?	After-School-Special
GUY 1	 Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party. In the bathroom.	DEACON	 (crushed) You're kidding.	DEACON	 Rachael! What are you doing?	RACHAEL	 We've been together for a year now, and I thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level.	After-School-Special
FRED	 Did you videotape it?	MATT	 (sarcastically) Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with me.	FRED	 You are the biggest moron I have ever known.	DEACON	 Hey, guys. Here's the money.	After-School-Special
DEACON	 Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.	FRED	 It doesn't get any better than that. You and Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air. (scoffs) "I have a math test tomorrow."	DEACON	 Will you shut up already? (beat) Look, I've been thinking about this all day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.	MATT	 So?	After-School-Special
FRED	 It doesn't get any better than that. You and Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air. (scoffs) "I have a math test tomorrow."	DEACON	 Will you shut up already? (beat) Look, I've been thinking about this all day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.	MATT	 So?	DEACON	 So we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. This year is our year. (takes the chain off his bike) There's nothing holding us back any more.	After-School-Special
MATT	 So?	DEACON	 So we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. This year is our year. (takes the chain off his bike) There's nothing holding us back any more.	DEACON (CONT'D)	 You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. That could be us.	FRED	 That's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.	After-School-Special
MATT	 Ooh. Good movie.	DEACON AND MATT	 (with Cuban accents) "First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women."	FRED	 So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords?	DEACON	 Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls.	After-School-Special
MR. LEWIS	 Are you ready for the big present?	DEACON	 (laying it on thick) You mean there's more?	MR. LEWIS	 It's in the garage. Come with us.	MR. LEWIS	 It's a new computer system. You've been talking about it for months.	After-School-Special
FRED	 Fine. Watch your balls. REVEAL TOM COOPERMAN dancing up a storm, in a heated competition against several challengers. The CROWD goes wild at Coop's moves. The DOORBELL RINGS. Continuing his dance steps, Coop moves to the door. Deacon, Fred, and Matt stand on the porch, waiting. The door opens, and we see Coop dancing all the way to the front door.	COOP	 (ad lib) Grommets!	DEACON	 Hey, Coop. Can we come in? Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names on it. He examines it for a long time.	COOP	 Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt. Y'all ain't on the list. He goes to close the door. Deacon stops it with his foot. Fred flinches.	After-School-Special
DEACON	 Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me some slack, all right? Coop looks him over, then opens the door.	COOP	 (ad lib) Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you say so? Happy birthday, friend. The guys look at each other, excited. They look back at Roger, five feet behind them at the bottom of the steps.	ROGER	 Little help? People drinking, dancing, couples making out. Girls everywhere. And over near the keg is...	DEACON	 (in a trance) Oh, my God. There's Naomi.	After-School-Special
ROGER	 Little help? People drinking, dancing, couples making out. Girls everywhere. And over near the keg is...	DEACON	 (in a trance) Oh, my God. There's Naomi.	FRED	 She looks good.	FRED	 She spilled her beer.	After-School-Special
NAOMI	 Happy Birthday, Deacon.	DEACON	 (pleasantly surprised) You remembered.	NAOMI	 Well, I got this flyer and--	DEACON	 Oh, right. So where's Jake?	After-School-Special
NAOMI	 Like I care.	DEACON	 (hopeful) So you two aren't going out any more?	NAOMI	 Duh.	JAKE (O.S.)	 Freakin!	After-School-Special
MARK	 No, seriously. It's cool.	KELLY	 (come hither) Come on, Deacon.	WENDY	 Yeah. Come on.	DEACON	 All right.	After-School-Special
JAKE (O.S.)	 Coop's doing funnels. Come on. J.T. (rubbing it in) Sorry, dude.	DEACON	 Hey, give me back my clothes!	JAKE	 Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to turn on the LIGHTS.			After-School-Special
NAOMI (CONT'D)	 So where did Rachael go off to?	DEACON	 She went to Paris with the French Club. (then, taking a chance) We're seeing other people.	JAKE (O.S.)	 Hey, sphincter.	DEACON	 Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right?	After-School-Special
JAKE	 Oops. Sorry.	DEACON	 (emphatic) Look, mom. I need a car.	MRS. LEWIS	 But I thought we agreed--	DEACON	 I need a car of my own.	After-School-Special
FRED	 Hey, asshole. Don't just come barging in here. We could have been naked.	DEACON	 (excited) Shut up. I figured out how to get back on the Tony Montana track.... So, I'm at the zoo today...	BIOLOGY TEACHER	 People! People! Come quickly. Witness the miracle of nature at its most primal.	DEACON (V.O.)	 And these monkeys are doing it. I mean, they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it.	After-School-Special
DEACON (V.O.)	 And these monkeys are doing it. I mean, they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it.	BIOLOGY TEACHER	 (getting hot and bothered) With one final thrust of his engorged penis, the male deposits his seed and moves on. (suddenly bitter) Probably to a younger, more desirable female. One who doesn't have any "issues." Whatever that means.	DEACON (V.O.)	 That's when it hit me.	ROGER	 A little help!	After-School-Special
DEACON	 Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it."	MATT	 (sincerely) That was a really good speech, Deacon.	DEACON	 Thanks.	MATT	 Did you work that out before?	After-School-Special
DARLA	 Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first.	VIC	 (to Mike) Is he in there?	VIC	 So, you think you can just walk into my town and move in on my territory?	FRED	 We've got to have two forms of i.d. to prove she's over eighteen.	After-School-Special
GREITZER	 I'm Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00 appointment.	RECEPTIONIST	 Okay, Mr. Greitzer. I'll let the doctor know you're here for your... (checks the book) rectal exam. Have a seat.	DEACON	 No way.	FRED	 Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr. Greitzer's signature on file, his credit card number, and his social security number...	After-School-Special
MATT	 You're just jealous that you don't have a cool porno name like us.	DEACON	 Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ... (searching) Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man. Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon.	MATT	 That name sucks.	FRED	 You don't get it, do you? A porno name needs to be a very subtle thing. Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over the ground.	After-School-Special
MR. LEWIS	 And I'm telling the guy, he's got to use form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary, but Johnson's gotta be the big man. "We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two years." But Johnson's an idiot. He doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist anymore.	MRS. LEWIS	 Hello? (covers phone) Deacon, it's for you. It's a young lady named Palomina.	DEACON	 Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great. Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward to working with you, too.	DEACON (CONT'D)	 I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn money for a car.	After-School-Special
MATT	 When you have sex with a strange man, do you imagine it's like your boyfriend or something?	DEACON (O.S.)	 (over a walkie talkie) We're ready. Over.	MATT	 Roger. Over.	MATT (CONT'D)	 You can go in now.	After-School-Special
MAX	 Yeah, for ass-wranglers.	MRS. LEWIS	 Max! Inside the car (still in the garage), the three guys apply their fake facial hair to match their three new fake i.d.'s.	FRED	 Are we really going to do this?	DEACON	 Oh, yeah. He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure.	After-School-Special
FRED (CONT'D)	 Uhhhhh.	AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER	 (to the waitress) Seven and seven.	MATT	 You want mine?	AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER	 So what brings you boys to the Pretty Kitty?	After-School-Special
STRIP CLUB MONTAGE:	 51A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                 51A - Ashley slinks through the fog onstage and works the pole like good girl should: gentle but firm. - Various other Strippers (a Swedish stripper named PLANTAIN, the American Flag Stripper, a BLACK STRIPPER, and an EXOTIC STRIPPER) give the three guys lap dances, dance on the carousel, and generally suck up to them. - The guys are pounding drinks like there's no tomorrow. - Fred is nuzzling between Plantain's assets. - Deacon licks the Exotic Stripper's salty neck and downs a tequila shot. - The three guys are all on the bar now, doing a choreographed dance routine, and stripping to their underwear.	REVEAL:	 - Boot and rally. The guys wipe their faces and join a gaggle of Strippers heading into an Amusement Park. - Carney games. Matt wins a stuffed animal for Plantain. - Cotton candy, Roller Coaster rides, etc. - The group is crammed into a booth at the Fudge Factory, eating ice cream sundaes. Matt shoots the straw wrapper at one stripper. She whips some ice cream at him. Food fight! - Ashley is dropping the guys off back at Deacon's house in the Aerostar. She writes down her information on a picture of herself. There's a car full of Strippers waiting for her. - Just then, Jake pulls into the driveway next door. He sees the Strippers and the guys.					After-School-Special
MATT	 Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top.	ASHLEY	 Uh huh. (beat) Hey, did you guys shave or something?	DEACON	 Okay. I think we're ready here.	MATT	 Boom in position.	After-School-Special
MATT	 And ... action.	ASHLEY	 (wooden) These yearbook photos of the Debate Club are making me so hot. I can't help myself. THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY, Ashley slowly strips off her clothes. But before we get too good a look, we	REVERSE ANGLE	 FRED smiles ear to ear. DEACON gulps. MATT peers out from behind the camera.	ASHLEY (O.S.)	 I hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah. FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling. DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Deacon whispers,	After-School-Special
MATT	 Action. Jake opens a makeshift door to the office.	JAKE	 (wooden) Oh, my God. What are you doing?	ASHLEY	 I couldn't help myself. Please don't tell the principal.	JAKE	 Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.	After-School-Special
ASHLEY	 Me? How did you ... without even getting hard first?	JAKE	 (copping an attitude) What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay?	DEACON	 Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene again. Just relax. We can splice it together.	MATT	 We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage.	After-School-Special
FRED	 Oh, like you're the only one who can do that.	MATT	 (false bravado) Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake of the film. Hold this.	DEACON	 Matt. Stop it.	MATT	 No, I'll do it.	After-School-Special
MATT	 No, I'll do it.	FRED	 (grabs him) Matt!	FRED (CONT'D)	 Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay Ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment.	MATT	 Fine with me.	After-School-Special
COOP (CONT'D)	 (awestruck) You guys are gonna be legends of the school. Fred and Matt are huddled around the computer.	FRED	 Oh, I've got it. What if the Math Team Captain is in detention for something...	MATT	 For fixing grades for a girl...			After-School-Special
NAOMI	 Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed. She pats at the stain.	DEACON	 (genuine) Really? I didn't think you got embarrassed about anything. She smiles at Deacon, cheered up by the inadvertent compliment. The Bus HONKS for Deacon.	DEACON (CONT'D)	 Well, I guess I should go. He turns to walk away, when Naomi makes a decision to give Deacon a shot.	NAOMI	 Deacon, wait. Block me for a second while I change my shirt.	After-School-Special
DEACON (CONT'D)	 I want you guys to come. It's just, I don't know. I kind of had this vibe from Naomi.	MATT	 (still doesn't get it) We can just meet you there.	DEACON	 Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see you guys there. I've got to get back to class.	MATT	 Later.	After-School-Special
COOP	 Hide your head down here and I'll tell you when it's safe to come up.	FRED	 (snide; whispers) How's Naomi?	DEACON	 Fine.	COOP (O.S.)	 Not yet. This is the really scary part.	After-School-Special
COOP (O.S.)	 Not yet. This is the really scary part.	DEACON	 (whispers) Hey. Can I ask you a question?	DEACON (CONT'D)	 Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this?	COOP (O.S.)	 Oh, baby. Not yet.	After-School-Special
MRS. LEWIS	 You need to have a talk with him. He could be having S-E-X.	MR. LEWIS	 I need to give him a goddamn medal. (she storms off) What?	ASHLEY	 Let her go.	DEACON	 Are you insane? I've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade.	After-School-Special
NAOMI	 Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys, too?	COOP	 (sheepishly) Sort of.	MATT	 Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? And action.	ASHLEY	 This quadratic equation is so hard.	After-School-Special
NAOMI	 Shut up, Coop. This is important.	COOP	 (swings his arms out) And my nuts aren't?	DEACON	 Are you okay?	COOP	 I'm sorry, Ashley.	After-School-Special
NAOMI	 That's okay. Just go slow.	FRED (V.O.)	 (in Deacon's head) Every two minutes, they change positions.	FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)	 It's a basic rule of porno.			After-School-Special
VIC	 Did you say "After School Special"?	VIDEO DUPE GUY	 Shit, man. You must be crazy. (calling after them) Better watch your back, homie! You might get smoked!	DEACON	 What are we doing here?	NAOMI	 What? I thought you might want some new clothes.	After-School-Special
NAOMI	 Well what about me?	DEACON	 What's going on? Are we going to find another girl? (off their look) What?	FRED	 Matt and I have been talking.	DEACON	 Yeah. About what?	After-School-Special
ROGER	 Since I was like eight.	HAIRDRESSER	 (whispers) I know who you are. Don't worry. Your secret's safe. Come on. I just want to make one film to see what it's like.	ROGER	 That's great. But how can I help you?	HAIRDRESSER	 Oh, I get it. You help me, I have to help you. That's how it works. Okay.	After-School-Special
MATT	 Really?	ASHLEY	 Well, no. Popular, good looking guys always get the girls. (off their look) Hey, what was I supposed to say?	ROGER	 Hey, guys. Great party. He wheels off. The guys and Ashley do a double take. The Bouncer is checking off names from the invite list. A long line of people are trying to get in, including J.T. J.T. I can't believe these losers are having such a killer party. Coop is walking by and overhears the comment.			After-School-Special
WENDY	 No.	KELLY	 I think so. (off Ashley's look) No.	ASHLEY	 Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week?	KELLY AND WENDY	 No.	After-School-Special
ASHLEY	 Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out. A moment of realization.	DEACON	 Yeah, I guess I did. (beat) So I have to do this, don't I?	ASHLEY	 (joking this time) I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.	DEACON	 There's something I want to talk to you about.	After-School-Special
DEACON	 Yeah, I guess I did. (beat) So I have to do this, don't I?	ASHLEY	 (joking this time) I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.	DEACON	 There's something I want to talk to you about.	NAOMI	 What?	After-School-Special
DEACON	 Well, I mean, we don't really have anything in common. And we don't really even get along.	NAOMI	 You're breaking up with me? (beat) Can we still have sex?	DEACON	 Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.	NAOMI	 The only reason I went out with you was because I thought you were a nice guy. And now you're breaking up with me?	After-School-Special
VIC	 Relax. We're not going to kill you. The guys let out a collective sigh of relief. Thank God. A beat. Then Mike pulls out the HEDGE CLIPPERS.	MIKE	 (matter of fact) We're going to cut your balls off.	FRED	 What?!? The guys freak out, but Mike's gun keeps them in place.	VIC	 (re: Fred) Start with him.	After-School-Special
FRED	 What?!? The guys freak out, but Mike's gun keeps them in place.	VIC	 (re: Fred) Start with him.	FRED	 Why me? It was all Deacon's idea!	DEACON		After-School-Special
MATT	 We pre-sold copies of our video.	VIC	 (condescending) How many? Fifty? A hundred?	MATT	 No. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred twelve.	VIC	 What?	After-School-Special
DEACON	 What except? There's no except!	FRED	 Except you promise to supply us with quality porn free of charge. (off Deacon's look)	FRED   (CONT'D)	 It could come in handy. I mean, until we get girlfriends.	MATT	 And...	After-School-Special
DEACON	 No, Matt!	MATT	 (emboldened) And you have to maintain the artistic vision of After School Special.	VIC	 And what's that? Matt puts his arm around around Vic's shoulder.	MATT	 The key is to try and remember what it was like before you had sex. What did you used to fantasize about? A math teacher who bends over a little too far. The door to the girls' locker room open just a sliver. Going over to visit your friend and catching his mother coming out of the shower.	After-School-Special
DEACON	 Guys!	VIC	 Okay. We've got a deal, but you gotta give me all your master tapes. (to Matt) And kid. If you ever need a job, give me a call. He hands Matt a card. Deacon turns to Vic and shakes his hand.	MATT	 It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. ...	VIC	 Ramalot. Vic Ramalot.	After-School-Special
MAX (CONT'D)	 These are my demands.	DEACON	 Done. (beat) Did you know all along?	MAX	 Are you kidding? Who do you think made the first pre-order? Max hands him the tape and they shake hands. Deacon turns to			After-School-Special
