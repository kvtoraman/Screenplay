TANGO	 Of every dollar. Every VIG, every truckload, every girl, every ounce.      In the jar.	FRANK	 Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm giving it to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business. (reaches for his breakfast check) There are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way.

ANA	 This is your father?	FRANK	 You really don't know who that is? (she doesn't) It's Martin Luther King.	ANA	 It is not.	FRANK	 You're right. He was as important as Dr. King, though.	American Gangster 
SIBOTA	 So I hear. You have him come see me. We'll give him a try-out.	DETECTIVE	 What's this? (taking a .45 from Jimmy's pocket) Oh, that's it, I'm taking you in.

FRANK	 I'm just trying to make a living.	TOSCA	 Which is your right. Because this is America. But not at the unreasonable expense of others. That's un-American. (he studies Frank) You know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesn't represent its true cost of production. It's controlled. Set.	FRANK	 I set a price I think is fair.	TOSCA	 It's very unfair, in fact. Your customers are happy, but what about your fellow dairy farmers? You're not thinking of them.	American Gangster

I own it. I stand behind it. I guarantee it and people know that even if they don't know me any more than they know the chairman of General Foods.	JACKIE	 What the fuck are you talking about, Frank?	FRANK	 What you're doing, as far as I'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement.	American Gangster

FRANK	 Then maybe I'll kill them all just to make a fuckin point.	TOSCA	 You want to know who it was? I can tell you. It was a junkie. Or a rival. Or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name for himself. Or someone you forgot to pay off. Or slighted without realizing it. Or someone you put out of business by being too successful. (pause) Success has a lot of enemies. Your success is who took a shot at you. How you gonna kill it? By being unsuccessful? You can be successful and have enemies, or unsuccessful and have friends.
