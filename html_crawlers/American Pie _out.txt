FINCH	 Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool?	STIFLER	 (momentarily puzzled) I do when I'm throwing them at your mom, you damn freak. (then) Alright then, see you guys tonight. I'll look for you in the No Fucking section.					American Pie 
JIM	 Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.	FINCH	 ("for the hundredth time") This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.	KEVIN	 (checks his watch) Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.	JIM	 You can crash at Stifler's?	American Pie

OZ	 (sings along) And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --	KEVIN	 How the hell do you know all these random songs?	OZ	 It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.	American Pie 
JIM	 This was remade?  Into what?	OZ	 (chiming in as the chorus hits) Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...

KEVIN	 You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?	OZ	 (holds up a couple fingers) Contact, dude.	KEVIN	 Then where does a blowjob figure in?	OZ	 Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.	American Pie 
OZ	 Feels like warm apple pie, dude.	JIM	 Apple pie... (then) McDonald's or homemade?	FINCH	 Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.			American Pie 
JIM	 What would I say?	VICKY	 Just tell her what's on your mind. And smile, you've got a good smile. (then to Kevin) Come on.	KEVIN	 (to Jim) Gotta go.	JIM	 But --	American Pie 
VICKY	 Just tell her what's on your mind. And smile, you've got a good smile. (then to Kevin) Come on.	KEVIN	 (to Jim) Gotta go.	JIM	 But --	JIM (CONT'D)	 Kevin, get back here!	American Pie

SOPHOMORE CHICK	 Thanks.	STIFLER	 (gazing into her eyes) You're really beautiful.	SOPHOMORE CHICK	 Really?	STIFLER	 Uh huh.	American Pie 
SOPHOMORE CHICK	 I don't know if I want to be doing this.	STIFLER	 (sighs) Doing what?	SOPHOMORE CHICK	 You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.	STIFLER	 (shifty) No way.	American Pie 
SOPHOMORE CHICK	 You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.	STIFLER	 (shifty) No way.	SOPHOMORE CHICK	 (a little angry) Steve!

VICKY	 I think I've had one.	JESSICA	 Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex. (starts filling Vicky's beer) You've never even had one manually?	VICKY	 ...I've never tried it.	JESSICA	 Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?	American Pie 
JESSICA (CONT'D)	 Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set me off. (noticing Nadia next to them, she passes the tap along) Am I right or what, Nadia?	NADIA	 (no bones about it) You are right.  The hands are not always necessary.	JESSICA	 (to Vicky) See?	NADIA	 In fact -- I should teach you my own special method.  I developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague. You use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh.	American Pie 
NADIA	 (no bones about it) You are right.  The hands are not always necessary.	JESSICA	 (to Vicky) See?	NADIA	 In fact -- I should teach you my own special method.

JIM	 No, not again.	NADIA	 (sighs) I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.	JIM	 No!  I've got...reserve reserves!	NADIA	 It is too bad.  I was at first hoping you would ask me to the prom.  But...	American Pie 
MICHELLE	 I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --	JIM	 (interrupting) What was your name again?	MICHELLE	 Michelle.	JIM	 Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?	American Pie 
MICHELLE	 Really?  You seriously want to go with me?	JIM	 (so forced) Yes.  Seriously.	MICHELLE	 Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.	JIM	 Whatever you want.	American Pie 
KEVIN	 That's my trick!	VICKY	 It's everyone's trick, Kevin. (she turns to him) But I did pick it up from you.	KEVIN	 We've come a long way since Homecoming.	VICKY	 (playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.	American Pie 
KEVIN	 We've come a long way since Homecoming.	VICKY	 (playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.	KEVIN	 Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.	VICKY	 Like how?	American Pie 
VICKY	 I think you're so right, Kevin.	KEVIN	 (pause) You want to do it?	VICKY	 Yes --	VICKY (CONT'D)	 I love you.	American Pie 
OZ	 My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.	HEATHER	 (pause) That's nice.	OZ	 (shrugs) So you're going to Michigan?	HEATHER	 Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.	American Pie 
HEATHER	 (pause) That's nice.	OZ	 (shrugs) So you're going to Michigan?	HEATHER	 Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.	OZ	 Onions?	American Pie 
HEATHER	 Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.	OZ	 (dismissive) Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.	HEATHER	 Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.	OZ	 Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?	American Pie 
OZ	 You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.	HEATHER	 (smiles) ...yeah.	OZ	 Wanna swap your chips for cookies?			American Pie 
KEVIN	 Then what the hell are you talking about?	JESSICA	 Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. (then) Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.	KEVIN	 I don't get it, that really works?	JESSICA	 Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?	American Pie 
STIFLER	 Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.	OZ	 (cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along.	STIFLER	 No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.	OZ	 Our last game is this Saturday.	American Pie 
OZ	 ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...	HEATHER	 (pause) You can't sing at the competition.	OZ	 I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...	HEATHER	 (upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.	American Pie 
OZ	 I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...	HEATHER	 (upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.	OZ	 Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later.			American Pie 
HEATHER	 (upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.	OZ	 Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later.					American Pie 
STIFLER	 Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?	KEVIN	 (immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?	STIFLER	 Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.			American Pie 
KEVIN	 (immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?	STIFLER	 Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.					American Pie 
JIM	 Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!	KEVIN	 (gives that "You rock!" hand sign) You fuckin' rule!					American Pie 
KEVIN	 Yeah, we have something great, Vick.	VICKY	 Kevin... (very close, whispered) I want to have sex with you.	KEVIN	 (almost frightened) Now?!	VICKY	 No...I know the perfect time...	American Pie 
VICKY	 Kevin... (very close, whispered) I want to have sex with you.	KEVIN	 (almost frightened) Now?!	VICKY	 No...I know the perfect time...			American Pie 
KEVIN	 Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?	OZ	 (getting ticked) Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?	KEVIN	 Attitude?  Me?  I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!	JIM	 Back out?  You don't need us to get laid.  You afraid or something?	American Pie 
KEVIN	 It was a pact.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --	JIM	 (interrupting, pissed) I don't have to do shit!  Forget it already!	JIM (CONT'D)	 I'm tired of all this bullshit pressure!  I mean, I've never even had sex and already I can't stand it!  I hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here busting my balls over something that just isn't that damn important!  So fuck this stupid pact, fuck you, and fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out with that geek over there, 'cause at least she's got something else to talk about besides sex!  God damn!	FINCH	 At least I learned how to shit in school.	American Pie 
CENTRAL GIRL	 Yeah, we were up the whole night together.  We had one of those amazingly deep conversations, where you really feel like you get to know someone.	VICKY	 (nudge, nudge) "Deep conversation," huh?  Is that what you guys call it?	CENTRAL GIRL	 What else would I call it?			American Pie 
JIM	 Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.	MICHELLE	 It reminds me of this one time -- (changing thoughts) Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.	JIM	 Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.	MICHELLE	 Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.	American Pie 
KEVIN	 No!  Get out of here!	STIFLER'S BROTHER	 (running out of the room) Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers!					American Pie 
OZ	 Dieter.  My middle name is Dieter.	HEATHER	 Hmm.  You know that's (cracking up) really a shitty middle name!	OZ	 (laughing) I know, it sucks!			American Pie 
HEATHER	 Hmm.  You know that's (cracking up) really a shitty middle name!	OZ	 (laughing) I know, it sucks!					American Pie 
FINCH	 Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.	STIFLER'S MOM	 (dry) As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?	FINCH	 I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!	STIFLER'S MOM	 (deadpan) I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?	American Pie 
FINCH	 I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!	STIFLER'S MOM	 (deadpan) I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?	FINCH	 Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.	STIFLER'S MOM	 Pardon me?	American Pie 
FINCH	 Single malt?	STIFLER'S MOM	 Aged eighteen years. (she gives him a look) Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.					American Pie 
KEVIN	 Me too.	VICKY	 Okay. (a beat) Did you bring a condom?	KEVIN	 Yeah, right here.	KEVIN (CONT'D)	 So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?	American Pie 
MICHELLE	 Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!	JIM	 (flat) Okay, I get it.	MICHELLE	 Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.	JIM	 ...excuse me?!	American Pie 
KEVIN	 Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --	VICKY	 (interrupting) No, Kevin -- (she sits up) That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.	KEVIN	 It is far away...and we'll be on our own...meeting new people...	KEVIN (CONT'D)	 Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.	American Pie 
KEVIN (CONT'D)	 Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.	VICKY	 I know. (a beat) Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?	KEVIN	 What?	VICKY	 Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it. (hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev!	American Pie 
KEVIN	 What?	VICKY	 Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it. (hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev!					American Pie 
KEVIN	 (to Jim) I guess we'll call you two-ply.	OZ	 Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?	JIM	 No, no that's fine. (then, to Kevin) So you doing okay?			American Pie 
OZ	 Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?	JIM	 No, no that's fine. (then, to Kevin) So you doing okay?	KEVIN	 (a wistful smile) Yeah.	FINCH	 I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. (a beat) Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.	American Pie 
JIM	 No, no that's fine. (then, to Kevin) So you doing okay?	KEVIN	 (a wistful smile) Yeah.	FINCH	 I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. (a beat) Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.	KEVIN	 So Oz, you almost made it, huh?	American Pie 
KEVIN	 (a wistful smile) Yeah.	FINCH	 I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. (a beat) Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.	KEVIN	 So Oz, you almost made it, huh?	OZ	 (smiles) I'll just say that we had a great night together.	American Pie 
KEVIN	 So Oz, you almost made it, huh?	OZ	 (smiles) I'll just say that we had a great night together.	JIM	 Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.	OZ	 I know.	American Pie
