ACCOUNTANT	 What's to prevent it ?	CHARLIE	 Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you, I didn't build a two-billion-dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing. We can protect our interests. (pause, for a drink) We are still the most powerful nation in the world. Militarily.	CHARLIE	 (continuing) You know bodyguard; he was a captain in Viet Nam. You talk to him, except he won't talk. This kind of man can kill you with his pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.	CHARLIE	 (continuing) Carries a attache case at all times. You know what's in it ? (another sip) An Ingram Machine pistol.

CAPTAIN	 Winning the war by yourself.	WILLARD	 (he calls for the waiter) Part.	CAPTAIN	 Which part is that ?	WILLARD	 My part.	Apocalypse Now 
CAPTAIN	 Thirty -- sometimes fifty.	WILLARD	 You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them. (solemnly) I swear to God I would have, too, if ...	CAPTAIN	 I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.	WILLARD	 We do.	Apocalypse Now 
WILLARD	 (continuing) What do you want ?	CIVILIAN	 (indicating the Army jeep) If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.	WILLARD	 Whose orders ?	CAPTAIN	 Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.	Apocalypse Now 
WILLARD	 I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.	COLONEL	 Then you can appreciate Command's concern over their -- shall we say 'erratic' methods of operation. (pause) I have never favored elite units, Captain, including your paratroopers or whatever. Just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn't give him any priviliges in my book -- not in this man's army.	MAJOR	 We didn't need 'em in Korea -- no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy and an M-1 Garand, none of this fancy crap -- no sir.	CIVILIAN	 (stopping him) Major.	Apocalypse Now

COLONEL	 We have Special Forces A detachments all along the Cambodian border. Two here and another one here -- twelve or fourteen Americans -- pretty much on their own; they train and motivate Montagnard natives; pick their own operations. If they need something, they call for it, and get it within reason. What we're concerned with is here.			Apocalypse Now

KILGORE	 What'd you do for supplies?	WILLARD	 (he shrugs) Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.	KILGORE	 Can you trust them?	WILLARD	 No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.	Apocalypse Now

CLEAN	 How can you tell their weapons.. an' how far they're going?	WILLARD	 Mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest. their morale from the way they drag their feet, or the joints that may be lying around. If they're near a base camp, they wouldn't be conserving food; they'll be throwing it away half-eaten. If the branches aren't broken, their weapons are slung. But all this is just technique.. There's a feeling you get after a while, that's what's important. I was going through a village once. I was looking for a certain party. I took off my boots, and walked into each hut. It was midnight. I went into three like that and suddenly I realized Id gone into each hut the same way -- standing up -- so the next one I went in on my belly. An RPD burst took out the door a bit above my head. (he shrugs) Things like that.	KILGORE (V.O.)
