MISS STUBBS	 (mock-sighing) Jenny. Again.	JENNY	 Isn't it because Mr Rochester's blind?					An Education 
JENNY	 Or interest.	JACK	 (ignoring her) You don't need to be good at it. You just have to be interested in it.	JENNY	 Can I stop going to the youth orchestra, then?	JACK	 No. The orchestra shows you're a joiner-inner. Universities like joiner-inners.	An Education 
JENNY	 No. They don't want people who think for themselves.	JACK	 (missing the sarcasm, as is his wont) Course they don't.					An Education 
DAVID	 And you are...?	JENNY	 Jenny. (Beat) I've never seen a car like this before. C'est tres chic.	DAVID	 It's a Bristol. Not many of `em made.	DAVID	 How did the concert go?	An Education 
DAVID	 What are you playing?	JENNY	 (making a face) Elgar.	DAVID	 Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a shame he spent so much time in Worcester, don't you? Worcester's too near Birmingham. And you can hear that in the music. There's a horrible Brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough.	DAVID	 Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and Jews mix very well.	An Education 
JENNY	 I'm not a Jew!	DAVID	 (smiling) No. I am. I wasn't...accusing you.	JENNY	 Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I sit in the car with my cello?	DAVID	 Jump in.	An Education 
DAVID	 (smiling) No. I am. I wasn't...accusing you.	JENNY	 Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I sit in the car with my cello?	DAVID	 Jump in.			An Education 
DAVID	 Your father, this is?	JENNY	 (Darkly) Oh, yes. He'd say there's no point to them. They're just for fun. Apart from school concerts, of course, which are no fun at all, so we go to those. The proper ones don't help you get on.	DAVID	 Which of course is what is so wonderful about them. Anyway, you'll go one day.	JENNY	 (heartfelt) Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it seems as though that's what all this slog is for. If I get to University, I'm going to read what I want and think about what I want and listen to what I want. And I'm going to look at paintings and go to French films and talk to people who know lots about lots.	An Education 
DAVID	 Which of course is what is so wonderful about them. Anyway, you'll go one day.	JENNY	 (heartfelt) Yes. I will. I know. Sometimes it seems as though that's what all this slog is for. If I get to University, I'm going to read what I want and think about what I want and listen to what I want. And I'm going to look at paintings and go to French films and talk to people who know lots about lots.	DAVID	 Good for you. Which University?	JENNY	 Oxford. If I'm lucky. Did you go anywhere?	An Education 
JACK	 Well, when will you be sure? You can't let the grass grow under your feet, you know. Otherwise you'll be at the back of the queue.	JENNY	 (deadpan) I suppose so. I suppose the growing grass would knock you off balance, and then you'd fall over, and by the time you picked yourself up, there'd be a queue.	GRAHAM	 I might take a year off.	JACK	 What for?	An Education 
JACK	 What for?	GRAHAM	 (mumbling) I don't know. Maybe do some travelling, that sort of thing.	JACK	 Travelling? What are you, a teddy boy?	JACK	 (nodding at Jenny) You know she's going to Oxford, don't you? Oxford. English. If we can get her Latin up to scratch.	An Education 
JENNY	 They're for me!	MARJORIE	 (curious) Who are they from?	JENNY	 Gosh. Him.	MARJORIE	 Who's `him'?	An Education 
JACK	 What's going on here?	MARJORIE	 (drily, knowing the trouble this will cause) Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap.	JACK	 A chap? What kind of chap? Who? Why?	JENNY	 (patiently) He's wishing me luck for tonight.	An Education 
JACK	 A chap? What kind of chap? Who? Why?	JENNY	 (patiently) He's wishing me luck for tonight.	JACK	 Are you sure that's all he's wishing? And where does he get the money from?	JENNY	 He earns it, I expect.	An Education 
DAVID	 I meant the evening.	JENNY	 (embarrassed) Oh. Yes. Of course. Nothing.	DAVID	 Because I'm going to listen to some Schubert in St John's, Smith Square. My friends Danny and Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound?	JENNY	 Thank you. And I'd like you to take me. I'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap.	An Education 
DAVID	 Seven? And we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...But if you, if that's not...Well, we can always put you in a taxi.	JENNY	 (flat disbelief) Supper.	DAVID	 If you want.	JENNY	 The trouble is, we'll already have eaten.	An Education 
DAVID	 Well. I mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on Friday you could...not eat?	JENNY	 (embarrassed again) Oh. Yes. Of course.	TINA	 I'm sorry. I just had the strangest dream. I dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car I've ever seen. And then you came back and you didn't mention it.	TINA	 `Oo wazzee?	An Education 
TINA	 `Oo wazzee?	JENNY	 (light, playful) Just a man who's been trying to pick me up. We're going to a concert on Friday night. And then we're having a spot of supper.	TINA	 (shrieking) A spot of supper?	JENNY	 You've heard of supper?	An Education 
JENNY	 (light, playful) Just a man who's been trying to pick me up. We're going to a concert on Friday night. And then we're having a spot of supper.	TINA	 (shrieking) A spot of supper?	JENNY	 You've heard of supper?	HATTIE	 We've heard of it. But we've never eaten it.	An Education 
JACK	 I won't allow it!	JENNY	 (coolly) Fine. He's quite happy for you to take me.	JACK	 (uncertainly) Right. I will.	JENNY	 Good.	An Education 
JENNY	 (coolly) Fine. He's quite happy for you to take me.	JACK	 (uncertainly) Right. I will.	JENNY	 Good.	JACK	 Where is it?	An Education 
JENNY	 Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.	JACK	 (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews!	DAVID	 (pleasantly) I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David Goldman.	JACK	 I didn't mean I'm not against you... Actually, I did mean that, because I'm not, but...	An Education 
JACK	 (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews!	DAVID	 (pleasantly) I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David Goldman.	JACK	 I didn't mean I'm not against you... Actually, I did mean that, because I'm not, but...	JENNY	 Dad!	An Education 
JACK	 I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person I'd be against, if I were the sort of person who was against...people. You're not an old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and this is Marjorie.	DAVID	 (deadpan) You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny.	DAVID	 You're a lucky man, Jack.	JACK	 I suppose I am, yes.	An Education 
JACK	 I suppose I am, yes.	DAVID	 So. Gosh. (He looks around approvingly.) This is lovely.	MARJORIE	 Thank you.	JACK	 I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a drink?	An Education 
DAVID	 Simple as that.	MARJORIE	 (playfully) So shall I book some tickets for something?	JACK	 (still smiling) No.	JACK	 Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then.	An Education 
MARJORIE	 (playfully) So shall I book some tickets for something?	JACK	 (still smiling) No.	JACK	 Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then.	DAVID	 I was hoping Jenny would come with me afterwards to have a bite of supper with my aunt Helen.	An Education 
JENNY	 Bye.	JACK	 (sniffing the air) What's that smell? Has he got perfume on?	MARJORIE	 It's called after-shave, Jack. And it makes a change from carbolic soap.	JACK	 At least there's no confusion, if you smell of carbolic soap.	An Education 
JENNY	 I'm so sorry.	HELEN	 (amused) That's OK. It's nice, isn't it?	JENNY	 It's beautiful. Where did it come from?	HELEN	 Oh, South Ken somewhere.	An Education 
HELEN	 (nodding at the dress) This is...Well, it's good for this sort of concert, isn't it?	JENNY	 (quietly) Thank you.	HELEN	 We should go shopping together one day, if you want.	JENNY	 That would be nice. But South Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.	An Education 
HELEN	 Is that why you suddenly speak French for no reason?	DANNY	 (ignoring her) You must have seen her sing?	DAVID	 She's marvellous.	DANNY	 But you should see her in Paris, not here. David will take you.	An Education 
DAVID	 I'd love to. You'd fit right in.	HELEN	 (sympathetically) Better than here, really.	DAVID	 It's wonderful to find a young person who wants to know things. There's so much I want you to see.	DAVID	 Are you still all right to come and have a look at that Pembroke Villas place with me on Friday, Danny?	An Education 
DANNY	 Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a Burne-Jones coming up at Christie's on Friday. And I want it.	JENNY	 (laughing in disbelief) You're thinking of buying a Burne- Jones? A real one?	DANNY	 I just have a feeling that the pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.	JENNY	 I love the pre-Raphaelites.	An Education 
JENNY	 I love the pre-Raphaelites.	DAVID	 (excited by her education) Do you?	JENNY	 Yes, of course. Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman Hunt, so much. He's so garish.	DAVID	 Absolutely! Why don't we all go to the auction? Wouldn't that be fun?	An Education 
DANNY	 Next Friday morning. David will pick you up.	JENNY	 (crestfallen) Oh. Friday.	DANNY	 You're busy?	JENNY	 Well. Yes.	An Education 
TINA	 (to Hattie) I'm not interested in Schubert. I want to know what else was on the programme.	JENNY	 There was nothing like that. He was the perfect gentleman. He just said he wanted to take me places and show me things.	TINA	 Things plural? Oh my Gawd!			An Education 
AUCTIONEER	 Over to you sir. Four hundred guineas? Thank you. Four hundred and fifty...	DAVID	 (whispers to Jenny) Your turn.	AUCTIONEER	 No further bids?	DAVID	 Quick!	An Education 
DANNY	 You know who you are.	JENNY	 (to Danny) Jenny Mellor.	DANNY	 I know who you are, too. Tell him.	JENNY	 (louder,to auctioneer) Jenny Mellor.	An Education 
DANNY	 I know who you are, too. Tell him.	JENNY	 (louder,to auctioneer) Jenny Mellor.	DANNY	 Thank you. Couldn't have bought it without you.	DAVID	 Well done. A nerveless performance.	An Education 
DAVID	 How much?	DANNY	 (amused) Be careful, Jenny. You don't know who you're dealing with.	JENNY	 Half-a-crown.	DAVID	 You're on.	An Education 
MARJORIE	 And what else are we spending five bob on? What else are we spending sixpence on?	JACK	 Oh, nothing. (He gestures round the room.) It's all free. That vase was free.	MARJORIE	 It was, actually. It was a present from Auntie Vi.	JACK	 That chair was free. The sofa. We don't have to pay for anything. And even if we did, we don't have to work for it. That's the beauty of life, Jenny. Everything's free. Grows on trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He warms to his theme, and grows progressively more berserk.) We've got a lovely Oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's Oxford taken care of. And a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. I'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. I'll go and have a look.	An Education

I think I saw some at the back there, right next to the pocket money tree. I'll just nip out and check, see that they're doing all right.	An Education 
TINA	 You could always go to secretarial college with Hattie.	JENNY	 (sarcastic) Oh, thanks.	HATTIE	 Charming!	JENNY	 Oh, no.	An Education 
TINA	 Yes. She's got no time for boys.	JENNY	 (quickly) Bye, Graham.					An Education 
JENNY	 (curious) Hello.	JACK	 Oh. Hello. David does the most brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny. Actually, he can do all the Goons.	DAVID	 I don't think I'm very good at Eccles.			An Education 
JACK	 Oh, no, you've got him...	JENNY	 (impatiently) But what's he doing here?	DAVID	 I wasn't going to disturb you. I knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone.	JENNY	 (incredulous) You came to see Mum and Dad?	An Education 
DAVID	 I wasn't going to disturb you. I knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone.	JENNY	 (incredulous) You came to see Mum and Dad?	JACK	 Is that so hard to imagine?	JENNY	 And you're drinking? But it's not Christmas!	An Education 
DAVID	 Oh, English. Just like every other semi-employed layabout in London.	JACK	 (marvelling at the coincidence) English! Which college?	DAVID	 Merton.	MARJORIE	 Isn't that funny?	An Education 
JENNY	 Dad has never read any books.	JACK	 (stung) What's he written?	DAVID	 He wrote a children's book called `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' that did very well, I believe.	MARJORIE	 CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're talking about?	An Education 
DAVID	 Oh, once every couple of years. But next time, eh?	JENNY	 (disappointed) Hopefully I'll be there by then. So that won't be much use.	JACK	 (dubiously) Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night?	DAVID	 Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners.	An Education 
JENNY	 (disappointed) Hopefully I'll be there by then. So that won't be much use.	JACK	 (dubiously) Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night?	DAVID	 Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners.	DAVID	 Clive will get her a room in college. That's easy enough.	An Education 
JENNY	 (sotto voce) That was scandalous.	DAVID	 I told you. You owe me half-a- crown.					An Education 
HELEN	 There. You'll do. You can keep it. I can only wear so many every day.	JENNY	 (thrilled) Really? Thank you.	HELEN	 What about tonight? Will you be needing a nightie? Or not?	JENNY	 A nightie?	An Education 
HELEN	 I'm confused now. I thought you'd made him up?	DANNY	 (attempting, briefly, to be patient) No, we...Never mind.	DAVID	 There.	JENNY	 (reads) "To dear Jenny. With the pleasure of meeting you. Come and see me again soon. Clive."	An Education 
DAVID	 There.	JENNY	 (reads) "To dear Jenny. With the pleasure of meeting you. Come and see me again soon. Clive."	HELEN	 Dirty old man.	HELEN	 (sotto voce) Why are university girls so strange-looking?	An Education 
JENNY	 Yes, David?	DAVID	 (prompting) Bubbalub...	JENNY	 Sorry. Yes, bubbalub?	DAVID	 Would you mind if I had a look at what might one day be mine? Just a peek?	An Education 
DAVID	 Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not spoil things.	JENNY	 (disbelieving) Me? I'm spoiling things?	DAVID	 I think there must be some kind of misunderstanding.			An Education 
DAVID	 Jenny?	JENNY	 (still furious) No thanks. You go. I'll find my own way home.	DAVID	 Jenny!	DAVID	 It was an old map. A Speed. It was cooped up in that miserable little cottage, and she didn't even know what it was. What a waste! It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we are. It should be with us. We know how to look after it properly. We liberated it.	An Education 
JENNY	 Liberated! That's one word for it.	DAVID	 (quickly and passionately) Oh, don't be bourgeois, Jenny. You're better than that. I know you have fun with us. I can see it. You drink everything I put in front of you down in one, every last drop, and then you slam your glass down on the bar and ask for more, and it's wonderful. We're not clever like you, so we have to be clever in other ways, because if we weren't, there would be no fun.	DAVID	 And if you don't like it, then I will understand, and you can go back to Twickenham and listen to the Home Service and do your Latin homework. But these weekends, and the restaurants and the concerts..They don't grow on trees.	DAVID	 Do you understand? Of course you do. This is who we are, Jenny.	An Education 
DAVID	 I suppose you have homework to do.	JENNY	 Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank you. I had a nice time.	DAVID	 (surprised, despite his speech earlier) Really? In spite of the, the incident? With the map?	JENNY	 As you said in the car, it was a misunderstanding.	An Education 
JENNY	 Gosh. Yes. Loads. (Beat) Thank you. I had a nice time.	DAVID	 (surprised, despite his speech earlier) Really? In spite of the, the incident? With the map?	JENNY	 As you said in the car, it was a misunderstanding.	DAVID	 Exactly. A muddle.	An Education 
JENNY	 Paris. You can't buy them here.	TINA	 (suddenly looking at her suspiciously) You never bought them yourself?	JENNY	 (mimicking Tina's grammar cruelly) No. I never.	TINA	 Shut up, you stuck-up cow.	An Education 
TINA	 (suddenly looking at her suspiciously) You never bought them yourself?	JENNY	 (mimicking Tina's grammar cruelly) No. I never.	TINA	 Shut up, you stuck-up cow.	JENNY	 But I'll bring you some back, if you want.	An Education 
HATTIE	 He's taking you to Paris?	JENNY	 (smiling smugly) Oui.	HATTIE	 This term?	JENNY	 Peut-etre.	An Education 
JENNY	 You have such a Victorian attitude to sex, you two.	TINA	 Oh, sorry, Dr Kinsey. We're not all as experienced as you. I mean, you've done it...(She counts on her fingers) I make it never! Can that be right?	HATTIE	 But your parents are just going to let you swan off like that?	JENNY	 They don't know yet. David's got a plan, he says. He usually has something up his sleeve.	An Education 
TINA	 I've noticed that. What did he tell them when you had your weekend in Oxford?	JENNY	 (animated by the memory) Oh, it was....(She changes her mind) David went to Oxford. Merton. English. And he offered to show me round.	HATTIE	 So you have a good-looking boyfriend with pots of money, brains and a nice car.	JENNY	 Apparently I do.	An Education 
JACK	 It might not be a bad thing if he did.	MARJORIE	 (doubtful) Really?	JACK	 Well, if you think about it, there's more than one way of skinning a cat.	JENNY	 And who's the skinned cat, in this enchanting image? Me?	An Education 
JENNY	 Oh. Thank you. I    needed a new one.	GRAHAM	 (crestfallen) Oh dear.					An Education 
JACK	 She's a special girl.	DAVID	 Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello, young man.	JENNY	 This is Graham.	DAVID	 Graham, a pleasure. I'm David.	An Education 
JACK	 I've given him a glass of pop.	GRAHAM	 (stung) I'd better be going I have a stack of homework to do.	DAVID	 Yes. Well. You can put the pop away now. What is there for the grown-ups?	JACK	 A glass of something warming?	An Education 
DAVID	 Before you start on that little lot , I have a surprise. Next weekend, we're all going to Chez Georges to celebrate Jenny's birthday.	JACK	 (flatly) Lovely.	DAVID	 Chez Georges is in the Boulevard St Germain. In Paris.	JACK	 How d'you mean, Paris?	An Education 
JENNY	 You know the one, Dad.	JACK	 (panic rising) But..We haven't got any French money. And I'm not sure...I just don't think it would agree with me.	JENNY	 Dad!	JACK	 They don't like us, the French, you know. John Sutton at work went once. They were very rude to him. I'm not sure I'd like that.	An Education 
JACK	 I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but...It's not for me, Europe. We'll go another time.	JENNY	 (bitterly) You've just said you don't like Europe. What's going to change? It'll have to be Europe, won't it? Because it isn't going to be you.	MARJORIE	 I can take her.	JACK	 (genuinely indignant) To France? And leave me here on my own?	An Education 
MARJORIE	 I can take her.	JACK	 (genuinely indignant) To France? And leave me here on my own?	JENNY	 Oh, for God's sake.	DAVID	 Listen, I'm really sorry to have caused all this to-do. I just thought it might be nice. But I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle Daniel. They can have your tickets.	An Education 
DAVID	 Yes, that's the one.	JACK	 (relieved) Well, there we are.	DAVID	 (perplexed) Where are we?	JACK	 Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If Aunt Helen's going to be there...	An Education 
JACK	 (relieved) Well, there we are.	DAVID	 (perplexed) Where are we?	JACK	 Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If Aunt Helen's going to be there...	DAVID	 (the penny apparently dropping) Of course!	An Education 
JACK	 Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If Aunt Helen's going to be there...	DAVID	 (the penny apparently dropping) Of course!	JACK	 I didn't want to put a spoke in anyone's wheels. But if you look at it from my angle...A bachelor, taking my daughter off to Paris...	DAVID	 Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought it through properly. I do apologise, Jack. Would you prefer it if Helen took Jenny on her own? I don't mind. I've been to Paris before.	An Education 
TINA	 There are some things you must buy for us, and some things you only have to buy for us if you're a proper, true friend. (She points at Hattie, then at herself.) Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume. (She repeats the gesture) Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick. What have I forgotten?	HATTIE	 Those funny cigarettes you were smoking. Sobranies. Ten packets each.	SMALL GIRL	 Are you the girl going to Paris?			An Education 
JENNY	 And David..... if tomorrow night does happen, it will never happen again, so...	DAVID	 (alarmed) Why won't it ever happen again?	JENNY	 Because the first time can only happen once.	DAVID	 (relieved) Oh.	An Education 
JENNY	 Because the first time can only happen once.	DAVID	 (relieved) Oh.	JENNY	 So, please...No Minnies. No baby- talk. I'm not old enough for baby- talk. Treat me like a grown-up.	JENNY	 (brightly) I know. Let's go and sit in our sitting-room.	An Education 
JENNY	 (brightly) I know. Let's go and sit in our sitting-room.	DAVID	 (cheered up) Hooray! I'll order some champagne.	MONTAGE SEQUENCE - PARIS				An Education 
TINA	 How can you go back to double French when you've had a weekend with an older man in a posh hotel in Paris? You wouldn't catch me coming anywhere near this dump.	JENNY	 (artfully) It wasn't all glamour. We spent half the weekend at Heathrow in a hotel suite .	HATTIE	 A suite? Oh my God. Your life.	TINA	 You're going to miss it. All the swanning around in posh hotels.	An Education 
HATTIE	 You're not, are you?	JENNY	 (distracted) God, no.	TINA	 So? Won't you miss it?	HATTIE	 We'll miss it.	An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 Jenny, could I have a word?	JENNY	 Of course.(To Hattie and Tina) I'll catch you up.	MISS STUBBS	 You can do anything you want, Jenny. You know that. You're clever and you're pretty... But sometimes those things fight. I'm worried that at the moment clever Jenny and pretty Jenny are fighting.	JENNY	 What do you mean?	An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 He might not have to stop you. That's what I'm trying to tell you.	JENNY	 (frustrated) I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.	MISS STUBBS	 I'm telling you to go to Oxford. No matter what. Or you'll break my heart.	JENNY	 (quietly) Where did you go?	An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 I'm telling you to go to Oxford. No matter what. Or you'll break my heart.	JENNY	 (quietly) Where did you go?	MISS STUBBS	 Sorry?	JENNY	 (louder, bolder) Where did you go? Which university?	An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 Sorry?	JENNY	 (louder, bolder) Where did you go? Which university?	MISS STUBBS	 Girton. Cambridge.	JENNY	 Oh.	An Education 
JENNY	 I don't think you're dead. But...	MISS STUBBS	 (coldly) You'd better get to your next class.					An Education 
JENNY	 (looking at the Rolls- Royce) And we know the person who owns this?	DAVID	 Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a....	DANNY	 A bastard.			An Education 
DAVID	 You can see she's different. She's got everything. You've got Helen, and....	DANNY	 (drily) And you've got Helen with brains.	DAVID	 (rumbled) Yes.	DANNY	 I don't want to see her hurt.	An Education 
DANNY	 (drily) And you've got Helen with brains.	DAVID	 (rumbled) Yes.	DANNY	 I don't want to see her hurt.			An Education 
JENNY	 (knowing that she should make conversation, as all the couples around her are doing) Have you...Have you bought any more paintings recently?	DANNY	 Have I? Let's think? Oh, I picked up a little Piper the other day. A good `un, I think.	JENNY	 I'm still trying to work out what makes good things good. It's hard, isn't it?			An Education 
DAVID	 Jenny, we should go. It's late.	JENNY	 (disappointed) Oh. Yes.	DANNY	 Alas. One day, school will be over forever, and we can talk about art all night.	DAVID	 (to Danny) You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?	An Education 
DANNY	 Alas. One day, school will be over forever, and we can talk about art all night.	DAVID	 (to Danny) You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?					An Education 
DAVID	 I thought I had a ring. It wouldn't have been the right one. But it would have done for tonight.	JENNY	 (eyes twinkling with amusement) Oh, David.	DAVID	 I'm serious.	JENNY	 You're very sweet.	An Education 
DAVID	 What do you think?	JENNY	 (helplessly) Please take me home.					An Education 
JACK	 Well. Looked at it one way, you wouldn't really need to go now, would you? He's a man going places. And say what you like, but they know how to take care of their money, don't they? He'll see you're looked after.	JENNY	 (quietly, turning the words over in her mouth) I wouldn't need to go. Would you like to expand on that?	JACK	 You know what I mean.	JENNY	 All that Latin! All those essays! What was the point? Why didn't you just send me out prowling round nightclubs? It would have been less trouble. And I might have had more fun.	An Education 
ANN	 Does any here know me. This is not Lear. Does Lear walk thus?	TINA	 (sotto voce, to Jenny, in the seat next to her) No.	ANN	 Speak thus?	ANN	 Where are his eyes?	An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 Yes. But none of it is going to ruin their lives.	JENNY	 (coolly) We have a difference of opinion on that.	MISS STUBBS	 Let's see who's right. Come with me.	MISS STUBBS	 Please don't make me drag you out like a child.	An Education 
HEADMISTRESS	 Jewish? He's a Jew? You're aware, I take it, that the Jews killed our Lord?	JENNY	 (beginning to feel less intimidated by her surroundings) And you're aware, I suppose, that our Lord was Jewish?	HEADMISTRESS	 I suppose he told you that. We're all very sorry about what happened in the War. But there's no excuse for that sort of malicious and untruthful propaganda.	HEADMISTRESS	 Anyway, I can now see that you are even more in need of responsible advice than I realised. Is it true that you don't intend to sit for your exams? And therefore you won't be applying for University?	An Education 
JACK	 What are we going to tell people?	JENNY	 (witheringly) Oh, telling people. I'd forgotten that what we tell people is more important than anything.	JACK	 All that...	MARJORIE	 Jack!	An Education 
HELEN	 That's...Gosh. That's fantastic news.	DANNY	 (cool) Congratulations.	HELEN	 I thought you'd see sense about university.	HELEN (CONT'D)	 You'll stay pretty now.	An Education 
DAVID	 I thought that, too! I was wondering whether he might be a bit jealous.	JENNY	 (trying not to be pleased) Jealous?	DAVID	 You may have noticed that Helen's not really Oxford material. I'm going to keep him out of your way.			An Education 
JENNY	 Like that?	MARJORIE	 (oblivious) No. On the tea-pot.	JENNY	 (deadpan) Ah.	DAVID	 Just down from Russell Square. Two minutes' walk from the underground.	An Education 
MARJORIE	 (oblivious) No. On the tea-pot.	JENNY	 (deadpan) Ah.	DAVID	 Just down from Russell Square. Two minutes' walk from the underground.	MARJORIE	 Jenny! We could walk to...(She tries to think of somewhere Jenny might find interesting.) We could walk to the British Museum!	An Education 
DAVID	 Just down from Russell Square. Two minutes' walk from the underground.	MARJORIE	 Jenny! We could walk to...(She tries to think of somewhere Jenny might find interesting.) We could walk to the British Museum!	MARJORIE	 I'll leave you to it. Don't let it stew.	JENNY	 And this is where you're living?	An Education 
JENNY	 And this is where you're living?	DAVID	 I've stayed there for the last couple of nights. (Beat) On and off.	JENNY	 You've stayed there two nights "on and off"?	DAVID	 Is that tea ready? One sugar, please.	An Education 
DAVID	 Is that tea ready? One sugar, please.	JENNY	 (frustrated by his evasions) David!	DAVID	 I'm sorry. You must think I'm very odd.	JENNY	 No, but.... You seem to float around. I never know where you are.	An Education 
JENNY	 No, but.... You seem to float around. I never know where you are.	DAVID	 A wandering Jew.(He pauses to take a sip.) If I tell you something, will you promise not to laugh?	JENNY	 It depends on how funny it is.	DAVID	 (mumbling) I live at home.	An Education 
JENNY	 It depends on how funny it is.	DAVID	 (mumbling) I live at home.	JENNY	 We all live at home.	DAVID	 No. I mean...I live at home...in the same way that you live at home.	An Education 
DAVID	 No. I mean...I live at home...in the same way that you live at home.	JENNY	 But I live with my mother and fa...(It clicks.) You don't mean it.	JENNY	 Your mother and father?	DAVID	 Just my mother. My father's dead. I've been meaning to tell you, Minnie, and it would have been much better than all those silly lies. But...	An Education 
DAVID	 Jenny, I...	JENNY	 (as cold as ice) Take us home.	JACK	 What's going on?	DAVID	 There's been a...Jenny's had a bit of a shock.	An Education 
JACK	 (desperately) You can sort this out, can't you, David?	DAVID	 Of course I can. She's just got the wrong end of the stick about something.	JENNY	 Go inside, Dad.			An Education 
DAVID	 There's no point..	JENNY	 (screaming)	WHAT NUMBER?		DAVID	 Seventeen.	An Education 
DAVID	 Seventeen.	JENNY	 (bitterly sarcastic) Good grief. It's the truth.	DAVID	 Please. You have to understand. I was with you just about all the spare time I had.	JENNY	 Spare time? Spare time? I can't tell you how grateful I am.	An Education 
DAVID	 They're not going to listen to me now. Let me come round tomorrow. When everyone's calmed down a bit.	JENNY	 (suddenly desperate) Please don't leave me to tell them on my own. Please. You owe me that much. You owe them that much.	DAVID	 (sadly) I owe them a lot more than that. I owe them everything. They gave me you.	JENNY	 Two minutes. And then I'll come out and drag you in.	An Education 
JENNY	 (suddenly desperate) Please don't leave me to tell them on my own. Please. You owe me that much. You owe them that much.	DAVID	 (sadly) I owe them a lot more than that. I owe them everything. They gave me you.	JENNY	 Two minutes. And then I'll come out and drag you in.			An Education 
WIFE	 Oh. Hello.	JENNY	 (almost inaudible) Hello. I'm sorry. I think I must have the wrong house.	JENNY	 Yes. I wanted number...It's my cello lesson. Silly. I...	WIFE	 Oh, no. Don't tell me. Good God. You're a child.	An Education 
WIFE	 That's why he never goes through with anything. He does love them.	JENNY	 (looking into the pram) She's beautiful.	WIFE	 Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's four months old.	JENNY	 Four months!	An Education 
JENNY	 (looking into the pram) She's beautiful.	WIFE	 Thank you. He. (Bitterly) He's four months old.	JENNY	 Four months!	WIFE	 Yes. Babies often are that sort of age. Perhaps you can remember a night four months ago when he seemed a little distracted. Anyway. If you'll excuse us.	An Education 
JACK	 Well we've got to have this out. If you won't do it, I will.	JENNY	 (contemptuously) Sit down.	JACK	 I beg your pardon? I'm still your father, Jenny.	JENNY	 Oh, you're my father again, are you? What were you when you encouraged me to throw my life away? I'm a silly schoolgirl. Was, anyway. Silly schoolgirls are always being seduced by glamorous older men. But what about you two?	An Education 
JACK	 Just tell me that you didn't...you haven't, you know...You didn't....	MARJORIE	 (to Jack) I wondered how stupid you were. Now I know.					An Education 
DANNY	 I tried to tell him. I'm not speaking to him now, if that's any consolation.	JENNY	 (bitterly) It's a funny world you people live in. You both watched me... carrying on with a married man, but you don't think it's worth saying anything.	DANNY	 Ah, well if you want that sort of conversation...You watched David and I help ourselves to a map, and you didn't say much, either.			An Education 
HEADMISTRESS	 And what happens if some other chap wants to marry you during your studies next year?	JENNY	 (laughing bitterly) Some other chap? There won't be any other chaps. Not for a long, long time, anyway.	HEADMISTRESS	 I'm afraid I think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. No,I think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. You showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. And I must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now.	JENNY	 (bitterly) Is it really so grim, your satisfaction?	An Education 
HEADMISTRESS	 I'm afraid I think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. No,I think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. You showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. And I must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now.	JENNY	 (bitterly) Is it really so grim, your satisfaction?	HEADMISTRESS	 It gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away. Although, of course, you're not one of our schoolgirls any more. Through your own volition.	JENNY	 I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman.	An Education 
TINA	 Of course we didn't. Why would we stop you? Restaurants, hotels, foreign cities, no exams...	JENNY	 (Bitterly) Yes. Who'd have thought there'd be a down side to all that? I could tell you all about the imagery in Jane Eyre. But I couldn't see that a man who stole maps from old ladies might be a liar.	HATTIE	 Well, if you'd told us that we might have tried to stop you.	JENNY	 There are a lot of things I didn't tell you. I was dreaming.	An Education 
HATTIE	 Are you getting on with the work all right on your own?	JENNY	 (heartfelt) No. No, I'm not.					An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 Penguin paperbacks. Posters and postcards.	JENNY	 (apparently understanding something) Yes, but...That's all you need, isn't it?	MISS STUBBS	 Let's forget all about it.	JENNY	 A Burne-Jones.	An Education 
MISS STUBBS	 Still? Gosh, you sound very old and wise.	JENNY	 (heartfelt) I feel old. But really not very wise. Miss Stubbs, I'm....I need your help.	MISS STUBBS	 I was so hoping that's what you were going to say.			An Education 
DAVID	 I can see my behaviour must have been... confusing. But we've never sat down and had a proper chat about it all. About the whys and wherefores. They can wait. The important thing is that you're still my Minnie Mouse, and I love you, and you had fun. You know you had fun.	JENNY	 Yes. I had fun. But I had fun with the wrong person, at all the wrong times. And I can't ever get those times back, now.(Beat) Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every day I wake up and pinch myself. And when I think how close I came...	THE END				An Education
