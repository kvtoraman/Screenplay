JACK	 I'm not a young man. I have my savings.	FATHER BENEDETTO	 (in ITALIAN) My meagre income is subject to the vagaries of the stock market and with church attendance declining there's less and less money in the offertory. But if a man has God in his vaults... He looks searchingly at JACK.	JACK	 I don't think God is interested in me. Father.	FATHER BENEDETTO	 (in ENGLISH) I know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and Trebbiano. JACK is silent. The two men continue eating. Then casually:	American, The 
JACK	 I don't think God is interested in me. Father.	FATHER BENEDETTO	 (in ENGLISH) I know better than to try to make a convert over pheasant and Trebbiano. JACK is silent. The two men continue eating. Then casually:	JACK	 What are the snakes for, father? FATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal sign for secrecy.	FATHER BENEDETTO	 "The grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence." He has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission to extract the truth... and JACK knows it.	American, The 
JACK	 I'm taking pictures forty minutes north of here. Right up in the mountains. Father Benedetto said you might be able to help.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) You need models. For your photographs? Italian girls? He winks at JACK. He's being friendly.	JACK	 My publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis. The technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp. This suits JACK.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) Want me to take a look?	American, The 
JACK	 My publisher wouldn't stretch to a four by four and the park trails are playing havoc with my chassis. The technical English is slightly beyond FABIO's grasp. This suits JACK.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) Want me to take a look?	JACK	 Not really. I just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) You're a mechanic?	American, The 
JACK	 Not really. I just need something to work on a ruptured driveshaft.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) You're a mechanic?	JACK	 Just a hobby. I tinker. JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering the work benches. FABIO shrugs.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My garage is your garage.	American, The 
JACK	 Just a hobby. I tinker. JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering the work benches. FABIO shrugs.	FABIO	 (in ITALIAN) Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My garage is your garage.	JACK	 I appreciate that. FABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the resprayed Alfa Romeo. JACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet. Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the biggest one up.			American, The 
JACK	 It had to be chilled. They're Italian cops.	MATHILDE	 (disappointed) You think of everything.	JACK	 I'm paid to. Don't move. She freezes. JACK points slowly. On her tanned forearm is a BUTTERFLY.	MATHILDE	 Wow. They both stare at the insect, transfixed.	American, The 
JACK	 No. The BUTTERFLY flits away.	MATHILDE	 (sadly) Perhaps you do not have a woman in your life. It is not easy for us to keep relationships. Not in our world.	JACK	 I have an acquaintance. A beat. She waits for him to say more. He doesn't.	MATHILDE	 Friendships are transitory. It is... Suddenly, there's movement in the bushes. JACK snatches up his BINOCULARS. MATHILDE scans the tree cover.	American, The 
JACK	 I doubt it.	LARRY (V.O.)	 After everything I've done for you? The car, the cell phone (which you threw away), the safehouse, the fake passport? Someone has to pay for this shit, Jack! I have to pay for this shit. It comes out of my commission. You're my lousy profit margin. Why the fuck would I take a contract out on my own profit margin? You're not thinking straight. I was the one who told you to leave town! I told you to come to Rome! God damn it you've got a job to do! Why the Hell would I...	WHAM!	 Something smacks into the phone box at high speed.			American, The 
WAITER	 Tedesco? Olandese?	CLARA	 (to the WAITER) He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen: She repeats her order, articulating each word emphatically, like a teacher to a slow school child:	CLARA	 Una botiglia di acqua minerale et una Parasini, per favore. She isn't upset. It's just her way of letting both men know that she's in charge. The WAITER turns to her, deferring to her strength of character.			American, The 
JACK	 Why spoil the illusion? She looks at him and smiles.	CLARA	 (in ITALIAN) As long as we know it is an illusion. Her smile is only a little bit sad. Still, JACK doesn't know what to say. They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER.	WAITER	 Buona sera. Desidera? CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and moves.			American, The 
CLARA	 Bitchin'.	JACK	 (amused) Bitchin'?	CLARA	 It's- come se dice- `slang', no? Eco. She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce and holds it out to JACK.	JACK	 No thanks.	American, The 
CLARA	 It is good, you will agree?	JACK	 (his mouth full) I will agree.	CLARA	 (sensing his teasing) My English is nice!			American, The 
CLARA	 (sensing his teasing) My English is nice!	JACK	 It's bitchin'.	CLARA	 (defending herself) You know how to swear in Italian?			American, The 
JACK	 It's bitchin'.	CLARA	 (defending herself) You know how to swear in Italian?	JACK	 Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile.	CLARA	 "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia merde e morte: tuo cazzo un brufolo.	American, The 
JACK	 Look after it. In case.	CLARA	 (perplexed) In case? He wants to say it but he can't bring himself to. In case this is goodbye.	JACK	 Now go.			American, The
