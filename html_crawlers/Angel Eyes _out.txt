SHARON	 Can you hear me? (shouting, off) This one's conscious!	VOICE (O.S.)	 Paramedics on the way!	SHARON	 Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can you feel that?			Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 (to radio) Three Adam Five -- show us 1019 to the jail with one male prisoner.	KID	 Take off your uniform. Take off my handcuffs, bitch, and come back here. I want one touch.	ROBBY	 Give it a rest!			Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 I just dealt with the situation. The prisoner...	SANDERMAN	 And you don't see a pattern here? (pause) I want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. All right? Are you taking notes?	ROBBY	 You broke his nose.	SHARON	 He grabbed me.     End of story.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Looks great.	MRS. VANDER	 Y'know, I cried over the invitation -- just imagine me in church. (laughs) It'll be so good to spend time with you.	MRS.   VANDER	 You know Dan and I   renewed our vows last year. I    bet that's where your mom got   the idea.	SHARON	 Their vows?	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Is he looking more like you now -- or did he get lucky?	LARRY	 He's got Kathy's looks and brains and my strong back. You should feel his grip. (pause) You just passing by?	SHARON	 Place is coming along nice. The octagon window. Dad's signature.	SHARON	 Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about what's happening.	Angel Eyes 
LARRY	 What's happening?	SHARON	 (hurt) So you really weren't going to tell me? Nobody was going to tell me? Mom and Dad renewing their vows, the church, the party. Mrs. Vander is all excited. She bought a new dress. It's blue.	LARRY	 We're workin' on Dad. We think you should be there. We told him.	SHARON	 Mom told him?	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party.	KATHY	 (embarrassed) Oh. I hope you'll be there. (pause) Really.	SHARON	 Take it easy.    You too, Champ.	SHARON	 Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again.	Angel Eyes 
ROBBY	 Freeze!	SHARON	 (to radio) Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect fleeing south on Pico Place, young man, green jacket. No visible weapon... (to Robby) Robby!	ROBBY	 Right behind you! (to man) Stop and lie down with your arms... shit.	ROBBY	 Careful!	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 (to radio) Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect fleeing south on Pico Place, young man, green jacket. No visible weapon... (to Robby) Robby!	ROBBY	 Right behind you! (to man) Stop and lie down with your arms... shit.	ROBBY	 Careful!	SHARON	 I see him!	Angel Eyes 
ELANORA	 Can you be serious?	CATCH	 (as he works) What day is today?	ELANORA	 Wednesday.	CATCH	 No.	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 She's a police officer.	ELANORA	 (stops; worried) Are you in trouble?	CATCH	 No.   No trouble.	ELANORA	 Well... that's a good thing.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun?	CATCH	 (shrugs) He was going to shoot you.	SHARON	 He could've shot you. You have a death wish? You a bungee jumper?	CATCH	 No. I didn't have time to think about it.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Every time I close my eyes, I see that goddamn gun pointing at me and I don't know why I'm telling you unless it's because you were there and because I had three drinks, but I'm not ready to go inside and close my eyes and I don't want to go to your place and I don't want to keep driving around, so what the hell do we do?	CATCH	 Whew. I feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes. (pause) We'll do whatever you want.	SHARON	 What I want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute. What if you hadn' t been there?	CATCH	 I guess we were supposed to meet.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 So, we... smell each other?   Who says that?	CATCH	 I have no idea. (as they smile) I'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think when we die -- we come back in another form?	SHARON	 You mean like   a duck? No. I think dead is   dead. I've been thinking about   it all day -- and I don't want to   think about it anymore.	SHARON	 Why'd you do that?	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 Does that mean I'm going?	SHARON	 (flustered) No.    You don't have to.    I...	CATCH	 You okay now?	SHARON	 Oh.    You're here as a medic.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Why?	CATCH	 (shrugs) Must be the smell.	CATCH	 I better go.	SHARON	 Oh, God.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 It's looking great, Mom.	MOTHER	 (pleased) Thanks, honey. It's the best year ever for the impatiens. The very best.	MOTHER	 Let's go in.			Angel Eyes 
MOTHER	 You just think about the bad, and you never remember the good. I wish you remembered the good.	SHARON	 Sorry.  I wish I did, too. (then, almost like a child) Does he? Remember any good about me?	MOTHER	 Of course. He doesn't hate you. He just... still feels hurt.	SHARON	 Hurt?    I hurt him?	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 What else did you bring?   Food?	CATCH	 (opening the bag) You definitely don't deserve food. I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy...	SHARON	 Just black.   Black. Thanks.	SHARON	 So what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to Denny's? You never said one word about yourself last night. What d'you do?	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 Somebody who keeps appointments.	SHARON	 You're ducking. Don't duck. (then a thought) Oh, shit -- you're married, right?	CATCH	 I'm not.	SHARON	 I don't believe you.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 (sarcastic) Can I come in?	CATCH	 Yeah.   Sure.   Come in.	SHARON	 You live here? Nobody lives here. This place is some kind of front, a scam, a drop -- or what?			Angel Eyes 
ELANORA	 Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody. It's been almost two years.	CATCH	 (a warning) Nora...	ELANORA	 Every time I tell somebody, it gets a little bit easier. I'm not saying it goes...	CATCH	 Nora!	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 That doesn't matter.	ELANORA	 (smiles) She is pretty.	CATCH	 She's sort of pissed-off at me.	ELANORA	 Apologize.	Angel Eyes 
SANDERMAN	 Sharon...	SHARON	 (typing) Lieutenant...	SANDERMAN	 Anything bothering you?	SHARON	 Why?   What'd I do?	Angel Eyes 
KATHY	 He's okay now. He's torn up about it. Don't make him mad.	SHARON	 When Larry and I were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'Don't make your father mad.' (pause) Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?	KATHY	 He never would.	SHARON	 Oh.   Just you, huh?	Angel Eyes 
LARRY	 You don't come in here and call me names.	SHARON	 What do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag? (pause) Coward.	KATHY	 Don't hurt her, Lar...!	SHARON	 I know how it feels, 'cause I remember. I remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you -- and for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. (pause) And so did I.	Angel Eyes 
KATHY	 Don't hurt her, Lar...!	SHARON	 I know how it feels, 'cause I remember. I remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you -- and for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. (pause) And so did I.					Angel Eyes 
LARRY (V.O.)	 I bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar, knocking me down in front of my family. You know what I've got in my hand? I've got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and I'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. I'm going to turn you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it.	SHARON	 (quietly) Oh, God. Oh, shit.	SHARON	 It's you, right?	SHARON	 Can you just shut up?    Just shut up and listen.	Angel Eyes 
PINDELLA	 Catch?	CATCH	 (to Sharon) Drive, will you?	CATCH	 Drive!	CATCH	 Will you get off this street?	Angel Eyes 
YOUNG MAN	 Goin' uphill, man.	CATCH	 (to Sharon) You try it.	SHARON	 Try what?	CATCH	 Go ahead. We need this. Everybody.	Angel Eyes 
WOMAN	 I'm calling the police!	CATCH	 No.  I'm calling the police. (turns to Sharon) Hey -- police.	SHARON	 Jesus Christ, Catch.	CATCH	 Maybe she'll think about it now.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 I thought you walked all over the city.	CATCH	 (gasping) The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I've burned every calorie I ever had.	SHARON	 My favorite lunch spot is another half mile.	CATCH	 Up?!	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we rolled on a 415. Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and I usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her. Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and I carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and I wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and I had a nice visit with my brother Larry.	CATCH	 (softly) I'm sorry. That would make anybody sad.	SHARON	 Sorry you asked?	CATCH	 No.   No, you can always tell me.	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 So soon?	SHARON	 Some of us have to work. (teasing) You ever work?	CATCH	 Yeah.     I worked.	SHARON	 Oh?   You remember that?   Working?	Angel Eyes 
JACK	 How are you? Sit down. Been years. You been out of town?	CATCH	 (sitting) I've been around.	JACK	 Oh, man, I'm really sorry about what happened. I never got a chance to say...	CATCH	 We don't need to go there.	Angel Eyes 
JACK	 Okay. All right. So... what d'you want, a coffee?	CATCH	 I want my old job back. (pause) What d'you think?	JACK	 You been workin'?	CATCH	 No, but I'm up to speed.	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 No, but I'm up to speed.	JACK	 (thinks) Well, it's not good with Randal anymore.	CATCH	 No?	JACK	 No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im?	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 No.     That's good. Deeper.	CATCH	 (as he works) How heavy was this guy?	SHARON	 Like a truck.	CATCH	 God.     Tractor-trailer?	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 So... he says you can't go?	SHARON	 Can't you rub without talking? (then) It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don't want me there, I don't want to be there. All right?	CATCH	 All right. (then, as he works) Bad how?	SHARON	 Oh, Jesus!	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Can't you rub without talking? (then) It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don't want me there, I don't want to be there. All right?	CATCH	 All right. (then, as he works) Bad how?	SHARON	 Oh, Jesus!	SHARON	 My father used to knock us around, all of us. But I'm the one who called the cops -- finally. (pause) They say I turned against the family.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 See that place? He's going to be playing there every weekend.	RAY	 (impressed; to Catch) Oh, yeah? What d'you play?	SHARON	 It's music, Ray. You wouldn't like it.			Angel Eyes 
ELANORA (V.O.)	 Hello?	CATCH	 (softly) Hi.	ELANORA (V.O.)	 Hi! How are you? Have you been out in this great afternoon? Brenda took me for a walk.	ELANORA (V.O.)	 Anything wrong?	Angel Eyes 
PINDELLA	 I can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, I would appreciate being able to talk to him.	SHARON	 (desperate) You can help by just   telling me what's in the public   record. It'll take me half a   day to do a search. Can you tell    me? Just...	SHARON	 Can you please tell me what's in the record?	PINDELLA	 You were with him -- in the car. Your uniform threw me. Are you his friend?	Angel Eyes 
PINDELLA	 Remember?	SHARON	 (quietly) Yes.   I was there. I was there.	PINDELLA	 His wife's mother survived, but... she was paralyzed.	PINDELLA	 Elanora Chu.   She's still in town, I believe.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 Does he... still see her?	PINDELLA	 He used to. I don't know. (pause) I'm glad to see... he has someone else who cares about him. I know he's running from this. He left all his friends, his home, his whole life.	SHARON	 He says... he doesn't remember the accident.	PINDELLA	 He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help him with that. He resisted. Walked away.	Angel Eyes 
CATCH	 Don't talk about that!    Don't!	SHARON	 (breaking down) All right -- you talk about it! You tell me your family died and I say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and you say, I loved them... and I say, what an awful thing to lose a family...	CATCH	 (unravelling) Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why won't you stop?!	SHARON	 So you can have a life!	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 (breaking down) All right -- you talk about it! You tell me your family died and I say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and you say, I loved them... and I say, what an awful thing to lose a family...	CATCH	 (unravelling) Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why won't you stop?!	SHARON	 So you can have a life!	CATCH	 I have a life! We could have a life. We could get up and go to work and come home to each other and never, never talk about before. We don't need to do that! Why do we need to do that?!	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 I'm sorry for... what happened.     I know about the accident.	ELANORA	 (hopeful) He told you?!	SHARON	 No. I found out, and... I remembered. I was there.	ELANORA	 Oh.   Yes.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 I thought it might help him... come back, you know? But he wouldn't even go in. He screamed at me.	ELANORA	 (upset) What made you take him there?	SHARON	 For the truth...	ELANORA	 He knows the truth.	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 You both look so great.	MOTHER	 (nervous) You, too.	SHARON	 I just wanted to...	FATHER	 You coming to the party?	Angel Eyes 
HUSBAND	 Big police officer now.	SHARON	 Not so big. (to Mrs. Vander) Nice dress.					Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 It was a nice ceremony.	MOTHER	 (worried) Yes. We're running out of chicken, though. Nobody's eating the ham.	SHARON	 It's a great party, Mom.   You look happy.	SHARON	 Thirty-five years and still in love, huh?	Angel Eyes 
SHARON	 What're you doing?	LARRY	 (to crowd) Once the cops leave, we can really party.	LARRY	 Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home?			Angel Eyes 
FATHER	 Jesus -- you're here, aren't you? What d'you want?	SHARON	 I want to know! (then, quieting) Do you want me here? Do you love me, Dad? I want to know.	SHARON	 Do you... need to... check that again?	FATHER	 I feel like...	Angel Eyes
