ATTENDANT	 (in Japanese) He was delirious. But he asked for you by name. And... (to the Security Guard) Show him.	SECURITY GUARD	 (in Japanese) He was carrying nothing but this... He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.	SECURITY GUARD	 ...and this. The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.	ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN	 (in Japanese) Bring him here. And some food.	Inception
SECURITY GUARD	 ...and this. The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.	ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN	 (in Japanese) Bring him here. And some food.					Inception
SAITO	 But surely-to forget...?	COBB	 Information, yes. But an idea? Fully formed, understood? That sticks... (taps forehead) In there, somewhere.	SAITO	 For someone like you to steal?	ARTHUR	 Yes. In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. It's called extraction.	Inception
COBB	 Did she tell you, or have you known all along?	SAITO	 That you're here to steal from me? (beat) Or that we're actually asleep?	SAITO	 I want to know who your employer is.			Inception
COBB	 Well, we'll just have to hope Grandma's wrong about that won't we?	JAMES	 (over phone) Daddy?	COBB	 Yes? JAMES (over phone) Is Mommy with you?	COBB	 No. No, we talked about this, James. Mommy's gone. JAMES (over phone) Where? GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone) Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-	Inception
JAMES	 (over phone) Daddy?	COBB	 Yes? JAMES (over phone) Is Mommy with you?	COBB	 No. No, we talked about this, James. Mommy's gone. JAMES (over phone) Where? GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone) Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-	COBB	 I'll give some presents to Grandpa, okay? Just be good for-	Inception
ARTHUR	 Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?	COBB	 (shakes head) We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago. By now they know we failed. Time to disappear.					Inception
ARTHUR	 Stateside.	COBB	 (wistful) ) 'Course. Send my regards.					Inception
ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 (Saito nods) What are you thinking about?	SAITO	 Elephants.	ARTHUR	 Right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you.			Inception
SAITO	 Mr. Cobb...? There is one other thing I could offer you. (Cobb stops) How would you like to go home? To America. To your children.	COBB	 You can't fix that. Nobody could.	SAITO	 Just like inception.			Inception
ARTHUR	 I know how much you want to go home-	COBB	 (sharp) No, you don't.	ARTHUR	 But this can't be done.	COBB	 It can. You just have to go deep enough.	Inception
ARTHUR	 Did it work?	COBB	 (quiet) Yes.	ARTHUR	 Who did you do it to?	ARTHUR	 So why are we headed to Paris?	Inception
ARIADNE	 A work placement?	COBB	 (smiles Not exactly.					Inception
ARIADNE	 (mouth full) Aren't you going to tell me anything?	COBB	 Before I describe the job, I have to know you could do it.	ARIADNE	 Why?			Inception
ARIADNE	 But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life?	COBB	 (nods) While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming.	ARIADNE	 How could I ever get enough detail to Convince him that it's real?	COBB	 Our dreams reel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange,	Inception
COBB	 Stay calm. We're actually asleep in the workshop. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember?	ARIADNE	 (shouting over noise) If it's just a dream, why are you covering your-					Inception
ARIADNE	 How did architects get involved?	COBB	 Someone had to design the dreams. (to Arthur) Let's go another five minutes-	ARIADNE	 We were only asleep for five minutes? We talked for an hour at least...	COBB	 When you dream, your mind functions more quickly, so time seems to pass more slowly.	Inception
COBB	 Exactly.	ARIADNE	 I love the concrete sense of things- (stamps foot) Real weight, you know? I thought a dream space would be all about the visual, but it's the feel of things. Question is, what happens as you start to mess with physics...	ARIADNE	 It's something, isn't it?	COBB	 (quiet) Yes. It is.	Inception
ARIADNE	 It's something, isn't it?	COBB	 (quiet) Yes. It is.	ARIADNE	 Why are they looking at me?			Inception
COBB	 I know this bridge. This place is real- (serious) You didn't imagine it, you remembered it...	ARIADNE	 (nods) I cross it every day on my way to the college.	COBB	 Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.	ARIADNE	 You have to draw from what you know-	Inception
ARIADNE	 You have to draw from what you know-	COBB	 (tense) Use pieces-a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick-not whole areas.	ARIADNE	 Why not?	COBB	 Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.	Inception
ARIADNE	 That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb. (calls after him) She's a real charmer!	ARTHUR	 Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.	ARIADNE	 (surprised) She's his wife?			Inception
ARTHUR	 Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.	ARIADNE	 (surprised) She's his wife?	ARTHUR	 So. A totem. You need something small, potentially heavy...			Inception
EAMES	 `Course I would.	COBB	 (smiles) Not when you hear what I'm selling.					Inception
COBB	 Which is?	EAMES	 The relationship with the father. (downs drink) Do you have a chemist?	EAMES	 There's a man here. Yusuf. He formulates his own versions of the compounds.			Inception
COBB	 Let's go see him.	EAMES	 Once you've lost your tail. (Cobb reacts) Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in about two minutes after we did.	COBB	 Cobol Engineering?	EAMES	 They pretty much own Mombasa.	Inception
COBB	 (disarming smile) Yes?	SECOND BUSINESSMAN	 We need to-	SAITO	 Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?			Inception
SAITO	 Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?	COBB	 (jumping in) What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. Saito?	SAITO	 I have to protect my investment.			Inception
ARIADNE	 What was she like in real life?	ARTHUR	 (quiet) She was lovely.					Inception
COBB	 (dubious) Somnacin?	YUSUF	 (proudly) Yusuf's Somnacin.	COBB	 As good as the real thing?	YUSUF	 Better.	Inception
COBB	 Five.	SAITO	 Six. (to Cobb) The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.	COBB	 There's no room for tourists on these jobs, Mr. Saito.	SAITO	 This time, it would seem there is.	Inception
EAMES	 (counting) Eighteen, twenty-all connected, bloody hell.	YUSUF	 They come every day. To share the dream.	YUSUF	 See? Very stable.			Inception
YUSUF	 Tell him, Mr. Cobb.	COBB	 After a while... (looks at Saito) It becomes the only way you can dream.	YUSUF	 Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?	EAMES	 They come here every day to sleep?	Inception
ARIADNE	 You have to warn them if it's getting worse-	COBB	 (gentle) I didn't say it's getting worse. Look, Ariadne, I need them for this job. I need you for this job. Without your help, I'll never get back to my children. And that's all I can care about right now.	ARIADNE	 Why can't you go home, Cobb?	COBB	 They think I killed her.	Inception
COBB	 The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to the Australian energy conglomerate, Fischer Morrow. COBB (reads aloud)	"I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S		EMPIRE."				Inception
EAMES	 Now, in the dream, I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind... (draws a diagram) Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him.	ARTHUR	 (impressed) So he gives himself the idea.	EAMES	 Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. It has to seem self-generated.	ARTHUR	 Eames, I'm impressed.	Inception
SAITO	 It seemed... neater.	COBB	 Neater, huh? (gets to his feet) Well, now we have ten uninterrupted hours.	COBB (CONT'D)	 (to Ariadne) Nice lobby, by the way.			Inception
EAMES	 It's not going to take us long to crack Fischer open once we get going. We'll be out in a couple days, max.	ARTHUR	 How do we get out once we've made the plant? (to Cobb) I hope you've got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time.	COBB	 A kick.	ARIADNE	 What's a kick?	Inception
COBB	 Robert'll accompany the body Tuesday at the outside. We have to move.	ARIADNE	 (low) I'm coming with you.	COBB	 No. I promised Miles.	ARIADNE	 The team needs someone in there who understands what you're struggling with. If you don't want it to be me then you need to show Arthur what I just saw.	Inception
ARTHUR	 (indicates rain) Couldn't you have peed before you went under?	YUSUF	 Sorry.	EAMES	 Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf?			Inception
COBB	 We were blocked by a freight train.	ARTHUR	 (to Ariadne) Why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection?	ARIADNE	 I didn't.	COBB	 (snaps) Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?! Those weren't regular projections- they'd been trained!	Inception
ARIADNE	 I didn't.	COBB	 (snaps) Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?! Those weren't regular projections- they'd been trained!	ARIADNE	 How could they be trained?	ARTHUR	 Fischer's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself. His subconscious is militarized. It should've shown on the research-	Inception
ARTHUR	 Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security before. We just have to be more-	COBB	 This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur! (points at Saito) He's dying!	EAMES	 So we put him out of his misery.			Inception
EAMES	 He's in agony. Let's wake him up-	COBB	 No! (they lock eyes) It won't wake him up.	EAMES	 What do you mean, it won't wake him? When you die in a dream you wake up.	YUSUF	 Not from this. We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.	Inception
ARTHUR	 You trusted him? When? When he promised you half his share?	YUSUF	 (offended) No! His whole share. Plus, he told me he'd done it before.	ARTHUR	 Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb?	COBB	 You don't know anything about that. This was the only way to do this job, Arthur. I did what I had to do to get back to my children.	Inception
FISCHER	 Neither do I, Uncle Peter.	BROWNING	 (confused) Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it.	FISCHER	 He never gave me the combination.	BROWNING	 He did, he just didn't tell you that it was a combination.	Inception
COBB	 When we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense.	ARIADNE	 (low) And if he dies?	COBB	 His conscious mind will drop out of the dream. He'll be trapped in Limbo for a lifetime...	ARIADNE	 What will that do to him?	Inception
COBB	 If it's my dream then why can't I control it? Why can't I stop this?	MAL	 (it's obvious) You don't know you're dreaming.	COBB	 You keep telling me I am-	MAL	 And you don't believe me!	Inception
FISCHER	 We're worth much more to you alive...	EAMES	 (excited) His relationship with his father's much worse that we thought.	ARTHUR	 That helps us?	COBB	 The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.	Inception
EAMES	 You learned a lot, though. Right?	COBB	 (to Eames) I'll need a decoy.	EAMES	 No problem. How about a pretty young lady I've used before?	COBB	 Fine-	Inception
COBB	 Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again. Rod Green, Marketing. (to Blonde) And you must be...	BLONDE	 Leaving.	BLONDE (CONT'D)	 In case you get bored.			Inception
COBB	 Strange way to make friends. (off look) Lifting your wallet, I mean.	FISCHER	 Goddamn it. The wallet alone's worth-	COBB	 Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't worry, my guys are on it.			Inception
COBB	 What do you remember from before this dream?	FISCHER	 (thinking) Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter. (looks up) Christ-we've been kidnapped.	COBB	 Where were they holding you?	FISCHER	 They had us... in the back of a van...	Inception
FISCHER	 A locator?	COBB	 A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways... (thinking) This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them?	FISCHER	 5, 2... something... it was a long number. 528... 528, 4 something.	COBB	 (opens phone) Well, we know where to start. (into phone) Fifth floor.	Inception
FISCHER	 5, 2... something... it was a long number. 528... 528, 4 something.	COBB	 (opens phone) Well, we know where to start. (into phone) Fifth floor.					Inception
COBB	 Fischer's. I told him it was Browning's so he'd come with us as part of our team.	ARTHUR	 (impressed) He's going to help us break into his own subconscious.	COBB	 That's the idea. He'll think that his security is Browning's and fight them to learn the truth about his father.			Inception
COBB	 Explain it to them.	ARIADNE	 (into radio) Saito?					Inception
ARIADNE	 (she points) That's the antechamber outside the strongroom.	COBB	 What about the strongroom? Doesn't it have any windows?	ARIADNE	 Wouldn't be very strong if it did. (off look) Look, if you wanted to design it yourself-			Inception
COBB	 What about the strongroom? Doesn't it have any windows?	ARIADNE	 Wouldn't be very strong if it did. (off look) Look, if you wanted to design it yourself-	COBB	 It's fine. Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there.	ARIADNE	 These projections, they're part of his subconscious?	Inception
ARIADNE (CONT'D)	 Get him in there- (points to doors) Then, as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers.	EAMES	 Okay, Saito can hold them off while I plant the rest of the charges.	COBB	 Saito's not going to last, Eames.			Inception
COBB	 This is our neighborhood.	ARIADNE	 (confused) From what city?	COBB	 No. Our neighborhood. (pointing) That was our first apartment... then we moved to that building... we got that small house when Mal became pregnant.	ARIADNE	 You reconstructed them all from memory?	Inception
ARIADNE	 (confused) From what city?	COBB	 No. Our neighborhood. (pointing) That was our first apartment... then we moved to that building... we got that small house when Mal became pregnant.	ARIADNE	 You reconstructed them all from memory?	COBB	 We had time.	Inception
COBB	 Resilient... (turns to Ariadne) Highly contagious, and an idea can grow. The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world...	MAL	 The smallest idea, such as... "Your world is not real."					Inception
MAL	 So certain of your world. Of what's real. Do you think he is- (points at Cobb) Or do you think he's as lost as I was?	COBB	 I know what's real.	MAL	 What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream? Mutable laws of physics? Tell that to the quantum physicists. Reappearance of the dead? What about heaven and hell? Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah? They crucified Christ, didn't they?			Inception
MAL	 Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me.	COBB	 (rising anger) I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us.	MAL	 You're wrong, Dom. You're confused... our children are here-	MAL	 (whispers) And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom?	Inception
COBB	 Because it was my lie.	MAL	 (realizing) Because you planted the idea in my mind.	COBB	 Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards...	ARIADNE	 Why?	Inception
FATHER	 (hoarse whisper) I... was ... dis ... dis ...	FISCHER	 I know, Dad. You were disappointed that I couldn't be you.	FATHER	 (whisper) I was disappointed... that you tried.			Inception
FISCHER	 I know, Dad. You were disappointed that I couldn't be you.	FATHER	 (whisper) I was disappointed... that you tried.					Inception
ARIADNE	 You're coming!	COBB	 No, I'm not. I'm staying here to find Saito. (turns to Mal) And to say goodbye.	ARIADNE	 Don't lose yourself. Find Saito. And bring him back.	COBB	 I will.	Inception
BROWNING	 I'm sorry, Robert.	FISCHER	 The will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man, not live for him. (turns to Browning) ) And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.					Inception
