VITTORIA	 (in Italian, subtitled) Somebody pulled us off the grid, Phillipe.	PHILLIPE	 (responds in French, also subtitled) You hit 36kV down there yesterday. The whole synchrotron only loads 18.	VITTORIA	 (switching to French) And the LEAR's specked up to 42. It's all approved by the Director, you want me to call him?	PHILLIPE	 Waste of power, what're you extracting, still ten to the seventh APs a second?    How long to produce a gram at that rate?	Angels & Demons

VITTORIA	 About two billion years.     At that rate.	Angels & Demons 
VITTORIA	 About two billion years.     At that rate.	PHILLIPE	 Vittoria. (switching to soft	ITALIAN)	 Please don't blow us all to heaven.	DISSOLVES TO:		Angels & Demons 
(GESTURING)	 Bags under your eyes, up at five a.m., Italian accent... Do I hear Naples in those Rs?	VINCENZO	 (smiles, shows an ID) Claudio Vincenzo, Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.	LANGDON	 Vatican Police?    I was expecting another letter. (Vincenzo looks confused) My request for access to the Archives?	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 Shouldn't you be in Rome?   Busy time for you guys.	Angels & Demons 
VINCENZO	 (smiles, shows an ID) Claudio Vincenzo, Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.	LANGDON	 Vatican Police?    I was expecting another letter. (Vincenzo looks confused) My request for access to the Archives?	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 Shouldn't you be in Rome?   Busy time for you guys.	VINCENZO	 In fact I was in New York, on vacation.    I got a call in the middle of the night --- find Robert Langdon. A matter of great urgency.	Angels & Demons 
VINCENZO	 It's worse than just that.    Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside the Vatican some time between three and five a.m. this morning. Shortly afterward, the Office of the Swiss Guard received that document, along with the threat that the Cardinals will be publicly executed, one per hour, starting at seven p.m. tonight, in Rome.	LANGDON	 (mind racing ahead) Conclave?	VINCENZO	 Was to begin today.    We have postponed its start for a few hours, a story of illness, there are no suspicions. Yet.	LANGDON	 What do you want from me?	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 I wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the Vatican.	VINCENZO	 Oh, it didn't.     But it made you -- what is the word? (Italian pronunciation) Formidable.     Formidable.    A plane is standing by twenty minutes from here. Will you come with me?	VINCENZO (CONT'D)	 Professor Langdon, you have spent ten years of your academic life searching for the very symbol you now hold in your hand.     And the madman who created it, or who knows the secrets of its origin-- that person is in Rome. (checks his watch) How much longer must we pretend you have not already decided to come?			Angels & Demons 
MORTATI (CONT'D)	 It is as much a sin to offer flattery to accept it.	FR. SIMEON	 (chastened, but not	REALLY)	 The Camerlengo asks how long you can postpone the opening prayer without making another announcement to the public?	MORTATI	 Two years and three months. (Simeon looks confused) The conclave of 1316? (never mind)	Angels & Demons 
REALLY)	 The Camerlengo asks how long you can postpone the opening prayer without making another announcement to the public?	MORTATI	 Two years and three months. (Simeon looks confused) The conclave of 1316? (never mind)	MORTATI (CONT'D)	 Tell the Camerlengo the Cardinal Electors will take every minute required to perform their sacred trust.    No further announcements are necessary.	FR. SIMEON	 He's be concerned about the public dimension.    People will think-	Angels & Demons 
FR. SIMEON	 He's be concerned about the public dimension.    People will think-	MORTATI	 (cutting him off) What we tell them to think.					Angels & Demons 
ACCENT		ROCHER	 (to Vittoria) Ms. Vetra?    I'm Commander Rocher, Commandante Principale of the Swiss Guard.    Thank you for coming.     And Professor Langdon?	LANGDON	 That's right. Rocher looks him up and down, so, you're Langdon.	ROCHER	 Thank God, the symbologist is here. Ms. Vetra, this way, please.	Angels & Demons 
(CONTINUING)	 -- canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night.     The intruder killed my research partner, Leonardo Bentivoglio, and mutilated him in order to bypass security.	VITTORIA (CONT'D)	 We use retinal scanners. (they still don't get it) They cut out his eyes.	VITTORIA (CONT'D)	 That canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter.    We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City.	ROCHER	 I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra.    I haven't heard of antimatter.	Angels & Demons 
ROCHER	 And what might cause it to fall out of suspension?	VITTORIA	 The battery going dead.     Which it will. (looks at the screen) In six hours and eleven minutes.	VITTORIA (CONT'D)	 Where is that camera?   Number eighty- six?	OLIVETTI	 It's wireless.     It too was stolen. That could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls.	Angels & Demons 
VOICE (O.S.)	 We will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science... and then bring your church down upon you. Vatican City will be consumed by light.	LANGDON	 It's an ancient llluminati threat. (Rocher pauses the recording) The destruction of Vatican City through light.     The four pillars -- he probably means the kidnapped cardinals.     You didn't mention they were the preferiti. (to Vittoria) The favorites to be chosen as the new Pope.     Play it again.	VOICE (O.S.)	 We will destroy your four pillars... brand your preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science...	LANGDON	 Stop it there.	Angels & Demons 
ROCHER	 He said they'd be killed publicly. In churches.	LANGDON	 (nods, not surprised) Revenge for La Purga.	ROCHER	 La Purga?	LANGDON	 Don't you guys read your own history? 1668.     The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross.     To "purge their sins." Murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters.     It was after La Purga that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged.     This sounds like retribution. (to Rocher) Is there any more?	Angels & Demons 
ROCHER	 La Purga?	LANGDON	 Don't you guys read your own history? 1668.     The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests with the symbol of the cross.     To "purge their sins." Murdered them and left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church rulings on scientific matters.

Vatican City will be consumed by light...	VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	 A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 "A shining star at the end of the Path."    My thoughts exactly.	OLIVETTI	 (to Vittoria) If we find this bomb, can you deactivate it?	VITTORIA	 No, but I can change its battery, as long as it has more than five minutes of life.    That would give us another twenty-four hours to get it back to CERN.			Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 The llluminati called those four churches by a special name -- L'Altare di scienza.    The altars of science.	VITTORIA	 (making the	CONNECTION)	 "Sacrifice them on the altars of science," he said.	LANGDON	 Oh.   Oh, wow.	Angels & Demons 
MORTATI	 Seal the doors. INT      VATICAN ARCHIVES      DAY (in a suit and earpiece, not the traditional garb), leads Langdon and Vittoria toward the glass enclosures.	CHARTRAND	 (Swiss accent) The chambers are hermetic vaults, oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels.    It's a partial vacuum inside. More than ten minutes in the vault is not recommended without breathing apparatus.	CHARTRAND (CONT'D)	 I'll be just outside the door.			Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 Take a moment.     If you feel double vision, double over.	VITTORIA	 (bends over) Feels like I'm... scuba diving... with the wrong mixture.	LANGDON	 Plenty of time.	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 Uh... actually, I take that back.	Angels & Demons 
LAMASSE	 May God forgive you for what you've done.	MR. GRAY	 Father, if God has issues they won't be with what I've done -- (seems genuinely saddened) -- but with what I'm about to do.					Angels & Demons 
VITTORIA	 What makes you so sure the Segno is there?	LANGDON	 (while searching) The number 503.    I kept seeing it over and over in llluminati letters, scribbled in the margins, or sometimes just signed that way, "503."      It's a numerical clue, but to what?     Five, of course, is the sacred llluminati number -- the pentagram, Pythagoras, a dozen other examples in science -- but why three?	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 It made no sense. And then I thought -- what if it were a Roman numeral?	VITTORIA		Angels & Demons 
D-I-I-I?		LANGDON	 D3.   Galileo's third text. (ticking them off) Dialogo.    Discorsi.	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 Diagramma.			Angels & Demons 
VITTORIA	 So the path starts at Raphael's tomb!	LANGDON	 (not entirely	CONVINCED)	 Yeah.	OLIVETTI	 Raphael is buried at the Pantheon.	Angels & Demons 
VITTORIA	 Is the Pantheon even a church?	OLIVETTI	 (snatching up the	RADIO)	 Oldest Catholic church in Rome!			Angels & Demons 
ROCHER (CONT'D)	 -- a civilian into this situation. You have no communications and you can't carry a walkie-talkie, it's too conspicuous.	VITTORIA	 Tourists have cell phones, don't they? (pulls out her own and holds it to her ear) Hi honey, I'm at the Pantheon, you should see this place!	LANGDON	 You can't send her in there alone.	ROCHER	 I don't intend to.	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 Seven minutes to eight.	VITTORIA	 (of the watch) Was that Mickey Mouse?	LANGDON	 Long story.	VITTORIA	 Make it short.	Angels & Demons 
VITTORIA	 Where was he originally buried?	LANGDON	 I don't know... Urbino, I think... (thinking like crazy) Santi's earthly tomb... what else could it possibly... Santi 's tomb...	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 Damn it!    "Santi's tomb" must mean one of the chapels he built!    He's not buried in it, he designed it! Rich people commissioned burial chapels in churches all over Rome in his day! (looks up) And the "demon's hole," it isn't the oculus, it's an undercroft, a crypt, common sixteenth century term!	DOCENT	 Does anyone have any questions?	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 Commandante, if you care at all about your church-	ROCHER	 My church?   My church feeds the hungry, comforts the sick and dying. What does your church do, Professor? (no answer) Ah, that's right, you haven't one.	ROCHER (CONT'D)	 Take him if you want, but I'm done with him.			Angels & Demons 
IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,		OLIVETTI	 (calling down) You okay?	LANGDON	 More or less.	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 He's here!    I think he's -- sitting. (moves closer) Hello? (closer still) Are you all right?	Angels & Demons 
ROCHER	 His Holiness had health concerns; he was subject to seizures as well. But he took steps to make sure he was -- watched.    For safety.    That's all he wished to be made public, and that's all we should discuss.	VITTORIA	 (ignoring him) Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage. An overdose would cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages.    At first it might look like a stroke, but in a few days his body would show signs, we could easily-	ROCHER	 Ms. Vetra, in case you're unaware, papal autopsies are prohibited by Vatican Law.    We are not about to defile His Holiness's body just because his enemies claim to-	CAMERLENGO	 Of course we're not.    We'll make a public announcement refuting this absurd claim.	Angels & Demons 
FR. SIMEON	 As you say. Yet, technically, now that Conclave has begun, it is his privilege and duty to control public announcements. I've drafted a short release about the incident in the square, but any other statements are specifically prohibited. For that, the Cardinal has asked me to remind you -- we have a chimney.	CAMERLENGO	 As you say. (turns away) Commander Rocher, the search for the device?	ROCHER	 We've turned the power off and on to about twenty percent of Vatican City. Nothing on the video yet.	CAMERLENGO	 Mr. Langdon, you've been right so far, if belatedly, about the Path. It's now nine fifteen, how quickly can you find the next church?	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON (CONT'D)	 There are about twenty churches that intersect it.    None of their names invoke "fire," but there must be a Bernini sculpture inside one of them that does.    I'm going to need to get back into the Archives to find it.	CAMERLENGO	 (to Olivetti) Escort him.	VITTORIA	 The journals I asked for.    I'd like to stay here and study them.    If Leonardo told anyone else about our project, that could be the killer.	CAMERLENGO	 Fine.	Angels & Demons 
CHARTRAND	 Cfmmander Olivetti said I was not to leave your side this time.	LANGDON	 (a mutter) Wasn't me, it was her,	BAM!		BACK IN THE STACKS,		Angels & Demons 
CAMERLENGO	 If the Holy Father were given an overdose of Heparin... what signs would his body bear?	VITTORIA	 Bleeding of the oral mucosa. (off his questioning look) His gums.    Postmortem, the blood congeals and turns the inside of the mouth black.	CAMERLENGO	 Even though he died fourteen days ago?	VITTORIA	 It wouldn't show up until at least a week after his death.	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 You don't smoke, do you?	CHARTRAND	 (yes, a lot) A little bit.	LANGDON	 Sit down before you fall down.	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 My Italian's no good, what does this note say?   Next to the entry for The Ecstasy of St. Teresa?	Angels & Demons 
CHARTRAND	 Walls... lead-lined... no signal.	LANGDON'S HAND	 (Pow.)					Angels & Demons 
LANGDON	 You heard me ask permission!    You assigned me an escort!    Don't try to tell me you didn't know I was in there!	OLIVETTI	 (let me finish) Of course I knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are	OLIVETTI (CONT'D)	 cross-wired with that building. Commander Rocher was extending the search, if he'd known the Archives were on that grid, he never would have killed the power.	LANGDON	 Or there is the other possibility.	Angels & Demons 
VOICE   (O.S.)	 Polizia!	MR. GRAY	 (good Italian accent) Gendarmeria Vaticano!	UNDERNEATH THE BURNING PEWS,		ACROSS THE CHURCH,		Angels & Demons 
VITTORIA (CONT'D)	 I demand that you return them to me.	ROCHER	 (no attempt at a	DENIAL)	 They are material evidence in a Vatican investigation.	VITTORIA	 I am an Italian citizen and I have a right to-	Angels & Demons 
ROMAN COP	 Professor, I need to know what you saw here.	LANGDON	 Fire and death.    Show me where Santa Maria del Popolo is. (the Cop doesn't	UNDERSTAND)	 The Church, it was the first altar of science.	LANGDON      (CONT'D)	 And St. Peter's is...	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON   (CONT'D)	 Here.	ROMAN COP	 (behind him) Professor, I am asked to escort you to the Vatican immediately.    Commander Rocher has asked to see you.	LANGDON	 (ignoring him) Water.			Angels & Demons 
ROMAN COP	 (behind him) Professor, I am asked to escort you to the Vatican immediately.    Commander Rocher has asked to see you.	LANGDON	 (ignoring him) Water.					Angels & Demons 
ROMAN COP	 Professor!       The Vatican insists that-	LANGDON	 (turning on him) The Vatican is about to see its fourth Cardinal murdered tonight.	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 Now you can either do what they tell you and force me to go to the Vatican, where we can all mourn his death together, or you can show them how real cops act and take me to the Piazza Navona, where we might be able to stop it.	LANGDON (CONT'D)	 By all means, talk it over.    But in fourteen minutes he'll be dead.	Angels & Demons 
LANGDON (CONT'D)	 They were conservatives, the former Pope was becoming more and more liberal.    Maybe they loved their church so much they were willing to destroy it.	CAMERLENGO	 (thinking, repeats) Upon this rock I will build my church.	LANGDON	 St. Peter's tomb is the very core of Christendom.	CAMERLENGO	 The bomb is in St. Peter's tomb!	Angels & Demons 
CAMERLENGO	 The bomb is in St. Peter's tomb!	LANGDON	 (almost admiring it) The ultimate infiltration.	VITTORIA	 I can still change the battery if we hurry!			Angels & Demons 
THIRD CARDINAL	 Si, signore!	SECOND CARDINAL	 Of course! (answering those around him who look confused) Election by Adoration occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one individual's name.	THIRD CARDINAL	 And the law states that Adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements.    The candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy.	(DRAMATICALLY)		Angels & Demons 
(DRAMATICALLY)		BUT!	 (they listen) He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of election.					Angels & Demons 
CAMERLENGO	 But perhaps it's better that you're here.	ROCHER	 (raising the gun) Put it down!	FR. SIMEON	 You bastard!       You sanctimonious-	CAMERLENGO		Angels & Demons
