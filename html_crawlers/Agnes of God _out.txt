SECRETARY (V.O.)	 Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye.	MAN	 (in French)	???				Agnes of God 
MOTHER SUPERIOR	 (beaming at her own little joke) Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call Mother if you don't wish. (shaking hands) Most people find it uncomfortable.	MARTHA	 Well... I...	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (carrying right on) I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...			Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Well... I...	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (carrying right on) I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...	MARTHA	 Yes... I...	MOTHER MIRIAM	 You can call me Sister.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 How did she hide it during the day?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (indicating her habit) She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.	MARTHA	 Didn't she have any physical examinations	MOTHER MIRIAM	 We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Could there have been anyone else?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (a pause) Obviously there was.	MARTHA	 And you didn't try to find out who?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (standing) Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 And you didn't try to find out who?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (standing) Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.	MARTHA	 Why haven't you asked her?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (sitting again) She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Why haven't you asked her?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (sitting again) She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?	MARTHA	 Look, someone gave her the baby.	MOTHER    MIRIAM	 Yes, but that was some    ten months ago. I fail to see that the    identity of that somebody has anything    to do with this trial.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 The science of psychiatry.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (standing) Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.	MARTHA	 (also standing) I am not with the Inquisition.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open.	Agnes of God

AGNES	 I love you.	MARTHA	 (a pause) Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?	AGNES	 Yes.	MARTHA	 Who?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Who?	AGNES	 (chuckles) Oh, there are so many.	MARTHA	 Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?	AGNES	 Oh, yes!	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Where do you meet?	AGNES	 (obviously) In the confessional.	MARTHA	 Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau outside the...	AGNES	 You want to talk about the baby don't you?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Yes I do,    but I want you to...	AGNES	 (very agitated) I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants	MARTHA	 Then let's talk about something else...	AGNES	 (standing) No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Then let's talk about something else...	AGNES	 (standing) No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.	MARTHA	 (also standing) Agnes...	AGNES	 (opens the door) No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 (standing) No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.	MARTHA	 (also standing) Agnes...	AGNES	 (opens the door) No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.	MARTHA	 Would you like to ask them?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 (also standing) Agnes...	AGNES	 (opens the door) No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.	MARTHA	 Would you like to ask them?	AGNES	 (pausing in the doorway) What do you mean?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Would you like to ask them?	AGNES	 (pausing in the doorway) What do you mean?	MARTHA	 Just that... you ask and I'll answer.	AGNES	 Anything?	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 Anything?	MARTHA	 (smiles) Anything.					Agnes of God 
AGNES	 Why not?	MARTHA	 (a pause) I've stopped menstruating	AGNES	 Why do you smoke?	MARTHA	 Does it bother you?	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 I believe Agnes is different.	MARTHA	 From other nuns... (laughs) Yes I... I've noticed.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 From other people! (moving across the room) I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.	MARTHA	 How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 From other nuns... (laughs) Yes I... I've noticed.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 From other people! (moving across the room) I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.	MARTHA	 How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.	MARTHA	 (lights a cigarette)	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (moves to her desk, starts writing) In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.	MARTHA	 If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?	Agnes of God

She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Is Father Martineau in please?	HOUSEKEEPER	 (in French)	???		MARTHA	 (answers in French)	Agnes of God 
???		HOUSEKEEPER	 (halting briefly) Wipe your feet.	HOUSEKEEPER	 Pere Martineau... (in French)	???		Agnes of God 
FATHER MARTINEAU	 (French accent) They arise at five in the morning... and they're in bed by nine at night. Even if a man could get to them, he would probably find them praying. That's why I see that the real question is not only how he got in, but when.	MARTHA	 And you're the only man to see them?	FATHER MARTINEAU	 I promise you Doctor, even if I had the inclination, how could I possibly catch her? She would have to be a very slow and patient nun. (they both laugh) Ah no... they're a very special and rare people those Sisters. Only a few of them left in this modern world, consecrated to the praise of God.			Agnes of God

MARTHA	 Hello, Mama (pulls up a chair) ... brought you something.	MAMA	 Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.	MARTHA	 It's your favourite...			Agnes of God 
MAMA	 Who are you?	MARTHA	 It's Martha, Mama. (hands over a tub of icecream) There you go.	MAMA	 Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.	MARTHA	 I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.	Agnes of God 
MAMA	 Not any more... now I like chocolate.	MARTHA	 (stroking her hair) Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?	MAMA	 You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.	MARTHA	 (lighting up) Marie's dead Mama.	Agnes of God

I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.	MARTHA	 (lighting up) Marie's dead Mama.	MAMA	 I remember when you    was a little girl Marie. You come back    from the movies and you'd say - Mama    that ending was so sad... and I'd tell    you they had all the happy endings locked    away in a vault in Hollywood. (chuckles) And you believed me.	MARTHA	 Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 (lighting up) Marie's dead Mama.	MAMA	 I remember when you    was a little girl Marie.

MARTHA	 Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!	MAMA	 (a long pause) Who are you?	MARTHA	 I... I'm Martha, Mama.			Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 How do you survive?	SISTER ANNE	 Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, (indicating) some wheat, corn, some vegetables.	MARTHA	 Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?	SISTER ANNE	 No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this?	AGNES	 (not looking up) I've been commanded by God.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (sighs) He talked to you Himself?	AGNES	 No.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 (not looking up) I've been commanded by God.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (sighs) He talked to you Himself?	AGNES	 No.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Through someone else?	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM (CONT'D)	 Why would she tell you to do this?	AGNES	 (looking up) Because I'm getting fat.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Oh, for Heaven's sake.	AGNES	 I am, there's too much flesh on me.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (genuinely distressed) That's not what he meant.	AGNES	 I...    I am a little child but my body keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be able    to squeeze into Heaven.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Oh my dear child.	AGNES	 (standing) God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Who?	AGNES	 Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 Of God.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (smiles) Yes, of God.	AGNES	 I'm being punished.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Why?	Agnes of God 
LARRY	 Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.	MARTHA	 (kissing him) Thanks...					Agnes of God 
FATHER MARTINEAU	 Yes...	AGNES	 (very quietly) I thought... thoughts... about...	FATHER MARTINEAU	 Speak up, I can hardly hear you.	AGNES	 (very loudly) I thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite.	Agnes of God 
FATHER MARTINEAU	 Speak up, I can hardly hear you.	AGNES	 (very loudly) I thought ugly thoughts about Sister Marguerite.					Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?	LEVEAU	 (in French)	???		MARTHA	 I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.	MARTHA	 (crouching down) What else did she tell you?	AGNES	 She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.	AGNES (CONT'D)	 She lived here for almost seventy years. Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God. She took me to my secret place.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.	MARTHA	 (halting, out of breath) No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?	AGNES	 Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.	MARTHA	 Like what?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Like what?	AGNES	 (climbing again) Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.	MARTHA	 (following her) I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?	AGNES	 I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.	Agnes of God

AGNES	 I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.	MARTHA	 Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Do you believe she really saw them?	AGNES	 (sitting up) No, but I can never tell her that.	MARTHA	 Why not? (no answer) Mmm?	AGNES	 She'd get angry.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 (sitting up) No, but I can never tell her that.	MARTHA	 Why not? (no answer) Mmm?	AGNES	 She'd get angry.	MARTHA	 Agnes, did you love your mother?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Like you?	AGNES	 (suddenly frustrated) No, not like me!	MARTHA	 How would that person get one if they didn't want one?	AGNES	 (jumping to her feet) A mistake...	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 How would that person get one if they didn't want one?	AGNES	 (jumping to her feet) A mistake...	MARTHA	 Agnes, how did your mother get you?	AGNES	 A mistake... it was a mistake...	Agnes of God 
MARTHA		AGNES	 (very upset) If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... (distorted)	MARTHA	 Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...	AGNES	 I can't help it if I'm stupid.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 She is not a child.	MARTHA	 And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God... (Mother Miriams walks on) ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...	MOTHER MIRIAM	 ???     (distorted)	MARTHA	 ??? (distorted) ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.	Agnes of God

MARTHA		MOTHER MIRIAM	 (reads through the book) Oh, Dear God...	MARTHA	 What is it?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 The sheets...	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 It made them holy.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 It made them uncomfortable. And if (no answer) Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?	AGNES	 No.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Then tell me. Where are your sheets?	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Why?	AGNES	 (a long pause) They were stained.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.	AGNES	 Yes, Mother.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Should you see a doctor?	AGNES	 I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. (starts to weep) I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 For what?	AGNES	 I don't know... I don't know...	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM (V.O.)	 Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room. 50   INT - CATHEDRAL - DAY (beginning missed)	MARTHA	 No.	MONSIGNOR	 Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.			Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...	MONSIGNOR	 (halting) But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does	MARTHA	 I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?	MONSIGNOR	 Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 I breathed!	MARTHA	 Agnes. What did your mother do to you? (no answer) If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? (Anges shakes her head: no) Did she make you do something you didn't want to? (yes) Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? (yes) Did it embarrass you? (yes) Did it... did it hurt you? (yes) What did she make you you do?	AGNES	 No...	MARTHA	 You can tell me.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 What?	AGNES	 She touches me down there with a cigarette. (Martha gasps) Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.	MARTHA	 Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?	AGNES	 I'm afraid.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Are you intelligent?	AGNES	 (more forcefully) Yes I am.	MARTHA	 You're a mistake.	AGNES	 (shouting) I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 You're a mistake.	AGNES	 (shouting) I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...

MARTHA	 Agnes? (the nun shakes her head) Who?     Mother Superior?	ELDERLY NUN	 (in French)	???		MARTHA	 What?	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM		MARTHA	 (brandishing the files) Your niece!	MOTHER MIRIAM	 I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.	MARTHA	 No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 (crying) Oh God, if only I'd known.	MARTHA	 Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 I knew that after the fact.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Why didn't you do anything to stop her?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Because I didn't know... (she leaves)	MARTHA	 Oh, God.			Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.	LARRY	 You're too involved Marty. (lights her cigarette) Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?	LARRY (CONT'D)	 I'll ask around, see what I come up with. In the meantime you go home and get some sleep.	MARTHA	 Thanks. (she leaves)	Agnes of God

I would appreciate it if you would give me a phone call on 942-2424.	LARRY (V.O.)	 Hi Marty, it's me. Listen I just talked with Detective Crawley who was at the convent. She said that there was one thing that bothered her that didn't make it into the report. The waste paper basket. The one in Agnes' room.

MOTHER MIRIAM (CONT'D)	 So instead of questioning that one rule...	MARTHA	 (halting) It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Stupid woman... and that's all?	MARTHA	 That's all? That's enough!   She was a beautiful little girl.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 When I was a child I used to hear my guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I was six years old. That's when I stopped listening. But I remember the voice. A few years ago I looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And then one evening I saw Agnes standing by	MARTHA	 My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. (a long pause) Does my smoking bother you?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 No, it reminds me.	MARTHA	 Would you like one? Huh?	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...	MARTHA	 (chuckles) Long, thin and filtered.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. (they roar with laughter) And of course (distorted)	MARTHA	 Hand rolled.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 (chuckles) Long, thin and filtered.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. (they roar with laughter) And of course (distorted)	MARTHA	 Hand rolled.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Even Christ would partake socially.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Mary Magdelen?	MARTHA	 (imitating) Oh, you've come a long way baby.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 And Saint John would chew tobacco.	MARTHA	 Right. (a pause) What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 And Saint John would chew tobacco.	MARTHA	 Right. (a pause) What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.	MARTHA	 Do you think they ever existed?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Well you can try, can't you, to be good?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. (she stands) (Martha gets up too) Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.	MARTHA	 Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Listen to her singing.	Agnes of God 
MOTHER MIRIAM	 Listen to her singing.	MARTHA	 (a pause) I'd like to begin.	MOTHER MIRIAM	 Begin what?	MARTHA	 The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 Because I'm in trouble.	MARTHA	 What kind of trouble? (no answer) What kind of trouble Agnes?	AGNES	 I'm frightened.	MARTHA	 Of what?	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?	AGNES	 (a pause) I had a baby.	MARTHA	 How did you have a baby?	AGNES	 It came out of me.	Agnes of God 
AGNES	 She made me promise not to.	MARTHA	 Who?     Who made you promise? (no answer) It's    alright Agnes. It's alright. (a pause) Let's    go to your room. It's the night about    six weeks ago when you were very    sick.	AGNES	 I'm afraid.	MARTHA	 Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.	Agnes of God 
MARTHA	 Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?	AGNES	 Fish... (distastefully) ... brussel sprouts.	MARTHA	 You don't like brussel sprouts?	AGNES	 I hate them.	Agnes of God
