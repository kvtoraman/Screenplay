STEVE	 Okay, make it short and sweet.	CURT	 Yeah, well... Listen... (clearing his throat) I... I don't think I'm going tomorrow.	STEVE	 What! Come on, what are you talking about?	CURT	 I don't know. I was thinking I might wait for a year... go to city--	American Graffiti 
CURT	 Wait, let me explain--	STEVE	 You can't back out now! After all we went through to get accepted. We're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look, I gotta talk to Laurie. (he hands the check back to Curt) Now take it. We're leaving in the morning. Okay?	STEVE	 You wanna end up like John? You can't stay seventeen forever.	CURT	 I just want some time to think. What's the rush? I'll go next year.	American Graffiti 
STEVE	 We'll talk later.	RADIO	 (singing) "Here comes the Wolfman--Wolfman Jack!"	WOLFMAN (V.O.)	 Oh, We're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby. You got the Wolfman Jack Show!			American Graffiti

CURT	 What's wrong, he's crying!	TERRY	 I can't... believe... it. (He starts toward the car and gently caresses its paint.) I don't know what to say. I'll... love and protect this car until death do us part. (He circles the car.) This is a superfine machine. This may even be better than Daryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird. It is better than Daryl Starbird's.	TERRY	 Budda, how would you like to go to the drive-in movies with me?	BUDDA	 You've got to be kidding!	American Graffiti 
FIRST GIRL	 Judy's sister wants to ride with you. Is that all right?	JOHN	 (grinning) Yeah, sure, Judy--her sister--her mother--anybody. I'll take 'em all. Listen, we'll go up and stop at that light. It'll turn red by the time we get there. All right?	JOHN	 You ever get tired of going steady with somebody that ain't around--I'm up for grabs.	JOHN	 So, you're Judy's little sister.	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 Listen, listen. I think you better go back and sit with your sister. Hey, ah... where are they, anyway? They comin' back or somethin'? This is a joke, right? This better be a joke, 'cause I'm not drivin' you around.	CAROL	 But you asked me. What's the matter? Am I too ugly? (on the verge of tears) Judy doesn't want me with her and now you don't want me with you. Nobody wants me... even my mother and father hate me. Everybody hates me.	JOHN	 No they don't. I mean, I don't know, maybe they do. But I don't. It's just that you're a little young for me.	CAROL	 I am not! If you throw me out I'll scream.	American Graffiti 
CAROL	 I am not! If you throw me out I'll scream.	JOHN	 OK, OK, just stay cool. There's no need to scream. We'll think of something. (He looks at her as she wipes her eyes.) It shouldn't take too long to find your sister again.	VOICE (O.S.)	 Hey John--you gonna be there tonight?	JOHN	 Oh, shit! Hey, get down!	American Graffiti

LAURIE	 Who's stopping you?	STEVE	 (under his breath) Laurie, I thought since this was our last night together for 3 months, you might want to dance with me.	LAURIE	 How sentimental. You'll be back at Christmas.	STEVE	 I want to dance now, not at Christmas.	American Graffiti 
MR. WOLFE	 Hey, Warren. Come on, gentlemen, back inside. Put 'em out. Let's go.	CURT	 (grinning as he pulls out a pack of cigarettes) Kids... Want one?	MR.

MR. WOLFE	 Blotto. Exactly. Barfed on the train all the next day.	CURT	 (grinning) Cute. Very cute. Where'd you go again?	MR. WOLFE	 Middlebury. Vermont. Got a scholarship.	CURT	 And only stayed a semester.	American Graffiti 
CURT	 And only stayed a semester.	MR. WOLFE	 (smiling and nodding) One semester. And after all that, I came back here.	CURT	 Why?	MR. WOLFE	 (shrugging) Decided I wasn't the competitive type. I don't know... maybe I was scared.	American Graffiti 
CURT	 Why?	MR. WOLFE	 (shrugging) Decided I wasn't the competitive type. I don't know... maybe I was scared.	CURT	 Well, you know I might find I'm not the competitive type myself.	MR. WOLFE	 What do you mean?	American Graffiti 
CAROL	 I still got some, so don't try anything.	JOHN	 Hey, watch it will ya! Jesus Christ, thanks a lot. (looking at her angrily) Hey, drivin' is a serious business.

CAROL	 Say it--I'll tell him.	JOHN	 (quietly) I was a dirty bird, Carol's not grungy, she's bitchin.'	CAROL	 Okay--I'll think about it.	HOLSTEIN	 Where you going, Milner?	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 No, I wa at the movies--like I said-- sir.	HOLSTEIN	 Uh-huh. Milner, the reason I stopped you was because the light on your license plate is out. (opening his ticket book) I'm gonna have to cite you for that. And Milner, the front end of this... this... this thing you're driving looks a little low.	JOHN	 Oh, no sir. It's twelve and a half inches. Regulation size. Now, it's been checked several times. You can check it if you like, sir.	HOLSTEIN	 Look, Milner.	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 Thank you--asshole.	CAROL	 (looking over at him) You're a regular J.D.	JOHN	 Here, file that under C.S. over there.	CAROL	 C.S.? What's that stand for?	American Graffiti 
FALFA	 Hey, you see this Milner, you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh? Tell him I aim to blow his ass right off the road.	GIRLFRIEND	 (giving another snotty smile) Ain't he neat?

STEVE	 What's wrong with you! You're acting like a snotty--	LAURIE	 Oh God, come on.	American Graffiti 
STEVE	 Come on what?	LAURIE	 (pulling him toward the floor) Oh, Steven--please, everybody's watching. Smile or something.	LAURIE	 You think I care if you go off. You think I'm going to crack up or something. Are you conceited!	STEVE	 Quit--quit pinching--I don't know why I ever started taking you out in the first place.	American Graffiti 
LAURIE	 Oh boy! You can't remember anything-- the first one, up at the lake. That was the first time you kissed me--I practically had to throw myself at you.	STEVE	 (quietly) I remember.	STEVE	 What's wrong?	LAURIE	 Go to hell.	American Graffiti 
CURT	 Fine. Great. How've you been?	WENDY	 I'm coming--wait a sec. (turning back to Curt) She's got her car. Hey, I thought you were going away to school.	CURT	 Ah, maybe... maybe.	WENDY	 Same old Curt. All the time we were going together you never knew what you were doing... well, anyway, I gotta go.	American Graffiti

DEBBIE	 I'd love a double Chubby Chuck. Isn't that what you'd like more than anything right now?	TERRY	 (quietly) Sure...	MEL'S DRIVE-IN		TERRY	 A double Chubby Chuck, a Mexicali Chili Barb, two orders of French fries--	American Graffiti 
INTERCOM	 Ark, wark, dork.	TERRY	 (pushing the button) Now wait a minute. What? Huh?	INTERCOM	 Ark, wark, dork.	TERRY	 Yeah, right. Cool.	American Graffiti 
VIC	 Look who's talking. Who's the wimp you're hanging out with now? Einstein?	DEBBIE	 Tiger happens to be very intelligent. Unlike you. I know every thing your dirty little mind is thinking...

Speed up, you're losing her--	American Graffiti 
CURT	 What cruel fate keeps me from my true love? How am I ever going to meet her?	WENDY	 (to Bobbie) Did you know that my ex is going to become a presidential aide? It's supposed to be a secret, but his big ambition in life is to shake hands with President Kennedy. How are you going to accomplish that at J.C.?	CURT	 Maybe I've grown up. Maybe I've changed my mind.	WENDY	 Maybe you don't think you can do it!	American Graffiti 
CURT	 Why don't you move your bod into aft chamber, where we might discuss this in private.	BOBBIE	 (seeing that Wendy is considering it) Thanks a lot.	CURT	 Come on, Wendy? She doesn't say anything. They pull up to a stoplight. Wendy looks at the red stoplight and then abruptly gets out of the car and jumps in the back.	WENDY	 Well, slide over, I'm not sitting on your lap.	American Graffiti 
CURT	 Maybe.	BOBBIE	 (from the front seat) Look, there's Kip Pullman! He's so neat.	BOBBIE	 Do you know Kip?	CURT	 Huh? Yeah, I know him.	American Graffiti

CAROL	 If you say "Carol's not a bunny, she's a foxy little tail."	JOHN	 (quietly) Carol's not a rabbit, she's a foxy little tail.	CAROL	 You say the cutest things.	WOLFMAN (V.O.)	 Sneakin' around with the Wolfman, Baby.	American Graffiti 
JOE	 Hey, where ya goin?	CURT	 (turning) No place. Not going any place.	JOE	 Ya must be going someplace--I mean ya left here. Bring him over here, Ants, I want to show him something.	JOE	 Here--bend down, look here. See that? Right across there--see?	American Graffiti 
ANTS	 Tie him to the car and drag him.	CURT	 That's funny (clearing his throat) Hey, you guys know Toby Juarez? He's a Pharoah, isn't he?	JOE	 Toby Juarez. Yeah, sure we know Toby.	CURT	 He's a friend of mine.	American Graffiti 
ANTS	 Tied him to a car and dragged him.	JOE	 This is going to take some thinking. You better come with us maybe. (putting his arm around Curt) Go riding with the Pharoahs...	CURT	 Well, I don't think I can--I gotta--	JOE	 I know just how ya feel.	American Graffiti

MINIATURE GOLF COURSE AND ARCADE		American Graffiti 
LAURIE	 That's what Curt said.	STEVE	 Oh, figures. (smiling) You must've talked his ear off trying to get him to stay.	LAURIE	 That's not true. I didn't say anything. Curt just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry. He thought he should take it easy for a while, go to J.C. and try to figure out what he wants to do with his life.	STEVE	 That sounds logical.	American Graffiti 
LAURIE	 Steve! Don't.	STEVE	 (quietly) It's our last night together for three months... come on.	LAURIE	 We've been through this before.	STEVE	 I'm going to miss you so much. I need something to remember you by. You don't want me to forget you.	American Graffiti

STEVE	 What're you doing out here? Hey, where's my rod?	TERRY	 (choking) Um, oh, did I introduce you? This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.	DEBBIE	 Hello.	STEVE	 Hi.	American Graffiti 
CAROL	 I was just going to keep it for a little while. You're an ogre, just like my father. He won't let me play records, or stay out late, or anything.	JOHN	 (worried) He ah--doesn't like you to stay out late?	CAROL	 No--he's terrible. Once I was at a party that didn't end till late and he called the cops. Can you imagine? It was only a little after midnight and he had the whole police force--	JOHN	 Say, where do you live anyway?	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 Say, where do you live anyway?	CAROL	 Over on Ramona, why? (She suddenly smiles) Oh no. Uh uh. You thought I'd tell you where--not me, not old Carol. The night is young and I'm not hitting the rack until I get a little action.	CAROL	 What do you keep lookin' at? (she looks around behind them) Who's that? You know him? He's following awful close.	JOHN	 Grab onto something.	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 Grab onto something.	FALFA	 (shouting over) Sorry if I scared ya, man.	JOHN	 (looking ahead) Takes more than that to scare me.	FALFA	 Where ya been hiding? Didn't anyone tell ya I been looking for ya?	American Graffiti 
FALFA	 (shouting over) Sorry if I scared ya, man.	JOHN	 (looking ahead) Takes more than that to scare me.	FALFA	 Where ya been hiding? Didn't anyone tell ya I been looking for ya?	JOHN	 Hey, I can't keep tracka all the punks lookin' for me.	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 Field Cars drive through the fields, dropping cow shit all over the place to make the lettuce grow.	FALFA	 (laughing) That's pretty good. Hey, I like that paint job you got. What they call that--sorta a cross between Piss Yellow and Puke Green, ain't it?	JOHN	 Yeah, well, you're car's so ugly you must have to sneak up on the pumps to get a tank of gas.	FALFA	 Well, at least I don't have to move over to let a funeral go by, man.	American Graffiti 
FALFA	 Well, at least I don't have to move over to let a funeral go by, man.	CAROL	 (shouting) Your car's uglier than I am.	CAROL	 That didn't come out right...	FALFA	 Come on, boy, prove it. Let's go.	American Graffiti 
CAROL	 Oh, race him, you can beat him.	FALFA	 Hey, that's a tough lookin' girl you got with you, man. What're you doin'? Trying to pick up a few extra bucks babysitting? (grinning at Carol) Hey, Doll. Why don't you come on and ride with me--in about ten years?	JOHN	 Leave her out of this. This is just between you and me.	CAROL	 Wow! He's really fast, isn't he?	American Graffiti 
JOE	 Three, you are successful and you join the Pharoahs with a carcoat, and the blood initiation and all that, huh?	CURT	 (seeing Joe walk away) Wait--wait a minute. Wait a minute! What blood initiation?	WOLFMAN (V.O.)	 Oh, here we go baby! Here's "Come Go With Me."	MAIN STREET		American Graffiti

If you wanta come over, my girlfriend's away for the weekend.	STEVE	 I don't know...	BUDDA	 Why don't you? I never got a chance to talk to you. You're leaving tomorrow. Listen, I gave up a long time ago, so it'd be just for fun. No problems.	American Graffiti 
CURT	 Hold that up.	STEVE	 (taking the hood from him) I've been thinking--maybe you're right. Why should I leave home to find a new home. Why should I leave friends that I love to find new friends?	CURT	 Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've heard this already. Aren't you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you have to leave the nest sometime?	STEVE	 I realize that. I realize--	American Graffiti 
CURT	 No--no realizing. You've been telling me all summer that it's time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look at the big, beautiful world out there. Gimme this thing.	STEVE	 (letting him close the hood) I don't know--I--	CURT	 (banging the Citroen hood shut) I feel like a mid-wife.	STEVE	 I guess I was wrong. I may have been wrong.	American Graffiti 
STEVE	 (letting him close the hood) I don't know--I--	CURT	 (banging the Citroen hood shut) I feel like a mid-wife.	STEVE	 I guess I was wrong. I may have been wrong.	CURT	 Wrong nothing. You've been talking about getting out of this town for eight weeks. And now--goddamnit!-- you're just--you're just mentally playing with yourself. If you can just relax, we'll talk about it at the airport.	American Graffiti 
OLD MAN	 Sicker than a dog, that's for sure.	TERRY	 Ohh rats, I feel like-- (he notices a car nearby and pushes himself up) Wait a second... hey!	TERRY	 It's--oh my god--it looks like Steve's car. Look, right here under our-- it's my car. My car. We found it. Look!	DEBBIE	 Maybe we oughta call the police.	American Graffiti

DEBBIE	 (looking at John) Wow--you're just like the Lone Ranger.	JOHN	 (eyeing Debbie) Yeah. Listen, are you with the Toad, or were you with them?	TERRY	 You're talking to the woman I love...	JOHN	 What happened, man?	American Graffiti 
JUDY	 Well, we have.	STEVE	 (already annoyed) Oh yeah. So what?	JUDY	 So nothing. She was just with a really cute guy in a boss car. We wondered who he was.	STEVE	 I wouldn't know.	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 What's wrong, Toad? You lose the car again?	TERRY	 (softly) No... Steve took it.	WOLFMAN (V.O.)	 It's a shame, Baby. I'll tell yuh... Got to take it easy when you're drivin' that car of yours. You got to cruise easy, baby. Don't be doin' any accidents or anything on me.	DEBBIE	 You know, I had a pretty good time tonight.	American Graffiti 
CURT	 But I got to give him this note.	MANAGER	 (taking it from Curt) Here, let me see the note. (he reads it) Hell, that's just a dedication. All I gotta do is relay it. And it'll be on the air tomorrow, or Tuesday at the latest.	CURT	 No, no. See, this is very important. I may be leaving town tomorrow, and it's very important that I--damn it, that I reach this girl right now.	MANAGER	 You don't know whether you're gonna leave town or not?	American Graffiti 
TERRY	 John, I don't know what you're talking about. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. That guy, he might as well get a wheelchair and roll himself home. Man, you got... you got the bitchinist car in the Valley. You'll always be number one, John. You're the greatest.	JOHN	 Look at your glasses, man. (shaking his head) Okay, Toad. We'll take 'em all.	TERRY	 (grinning) Right.	JOHN	 We'll take em... let's get out of here.	American Graffiti 
JOHN	 Look at your glasses, man. (shaking his head) Okay, Toad. We'll take 'em all.	TERRY	 (grinning) Right.	JOHN	 We'll take em... let's get out of here.	TERRY	 Jesus, what a night.	American Graffiti 
VOICE	 It's not important.	CURT	 (excitedly) It's important to me. You're the most perfect, beautiful creature I've ever seen and I don't know anything about you. Could we meet someplace?	VOICE	 I cruise Third Street every night. Maybe I'll see you again tonight.	CURT	 No... I don't think so.	American Graffiti
