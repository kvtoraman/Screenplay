MITCHELL	 Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.	CORBETT	 (pats Mitchell's shoulder) Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.					Arctic Blue 
SPORTSMAN #1	 We're on our own, if it's any of your damn business.	CORBETT	 (re ermine) You did real good.	LEMALLE	 (to Corbett) No swinging shit.  They're over their goddamned limit.

SPORTSMAN #2	 I were you, I'd drive right on outta here again.  Now.	CORBETT	 (calmly) This was my roaming land, 'til the government took it over. Only Innuit can hunt here now, and tourists, like you.	CORBETT	 (continuing) According to tribal law, hunters passing through the land of another tribe can only take game to survive.  They can eat the meat, but have to surrender the hides.	LEMALLE	 Want the meat?	Arctic Blue 
LEMALLE	 I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with their shiny new car.	MITCHELL	 (to LeMalle) If you're gonna take something, take it and let's go.	(CONTINUED)		20   CONTINUED:  (2)		Arctic Blue

LEMALLE	 Think I'm pretty?  You better forget how we look, 'cause next time they won't keep me from killing you.  This land ain't quite civilized, you know...	MITCHELL	 At least he scalped the dead one.	Arctic Blue

WILDER	 (continuing) His old roaming area's all private reserve now.  Normally, long as he stays civil in my jurisdiction, I let him be. (beat) Won't be able to take him by my lonesome, though.

ANNE MARIE	 Oh.	CORBETT	 Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings. (off Anne Marie's amazed look) My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.	ANNE MARIE	 How did she..?	CORBETT	 I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-	Arctic Blue

When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.			Arctic Blue 
ANNE MARIE	 I don't want to talk any more.	CORBETT	 Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive.

ERIC	 Sounds like professional jealousy.	CORBETT	 Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life. (beat) Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.	CORBETT	 The idea was to get to the supplies before the bears did. Along the route we'd set our traps.  Made our year's living in three months.	CORBETT	 (continuing) Lot of times we didn't even have a landing strip.  We'd set down on a plateau, like that one there.  Yeah, that one's easy; you could glide right in...	Arctic Blue

CORBETT	 Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron. (beat) Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --	ERIC	 -- Turn around.	FADE TO:				Arctic Blue

Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.	ERIC	 I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.	Arctic Blue 
NEFF	 (explaining) He saw you and Corbett come in...	KENAI	 Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.	NEFF	 Don't let him fool you.  Real reason he's here is to buy Corbett's traps.			Arctic Blue 
NEFF	 Don't let him fool you.  Real reason he's here is to buy Corbett's traps.	ERIC	 (to Kenai) Okay.  You can talk to him.  But I'll keep the keys with me.					Arctic Blue 
NEFF	 (apologetically) Look, Ben, we don't want any trouble.  The kid's got the key, and besides, he looks edgy enough to use that magnum he's carrying.	CORBETT	 Relax.  I'll get loose in time.	KENAI	 Any traps you don't want, I'll pay cash money.			Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 What does this matter to you?	MEYERLING	 (sneering) You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.	ERIC	 I should release Corbett because you want some votes?	MEYERLING	 This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.	Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 Will you rent me a cabin, or not?	KENAI	 Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town. (shakes his head) I can't afford any trouble --	ERIC	 (takes out all his cash) -- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --	KENAI	 (grabs money) -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs. (walks away, then turns back) Why do this?	Arctic Blue

ERIC	 You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.	ANNE MARIE	 (stung by his coolness) What's going on?	ERIC	 I'll tell you everything later.	ANNE MARIE	 Where's Corbett?	Arctic Blue 
NEFF	 I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.	ERIC	 (angry) You don't care enough about Sam to --	NEFF	 -- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.			Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 Shut up!	CORBETT	 (to Anne Marie)	ERIC	 We're moving.  Let's go.			Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot. (hands her the .44) Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.	(CONTINUED)		168  CONTINUED:				Arctic Blue 
VIKING BOB	 (calls out) Ben?  Ben Corbett?	(CONTINUED)		170  CONTINUED:				Arctic Blue 
VIKING BOB	 Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.	LEMALLE	 (insulted) I'm right fuckin' here with you.					Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 Answer and I'll shoot!	CORBETT	 You kill me, you sign your death warrant. (re Anne Marie) And hers.					Arctic Blue 
LEMALLE	 (calls out) You hear me?  Ben?	VIKING BOB	 (to LeMalle) Ease off.  We do this my way.	VIKING BOB	 (continuing; calls out) Whoever's holding Ben Corbett, listen to me: we just want to know he's okay.  He is, nobody gets hurt.			Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 Say you're okay.  Tell them I'll kill you if they rush us.	CORBETT	 (shouts through window) Bob?					Arctic Blue 
(CONTINUED)		178  CONTINUED:	 (smiles) Be rude to let that happen after you kept me from freezing back there.	ANNE MARIE	 (to Eric) He's right about the snow.  We're blind.	VIKING BOB (OS)	 Ben?	Arctic Blue 
178  CONTINUED:	 (smiles) Be rude to let that happen after you kept me from freezing back there.	ANNE MARIE	 (to Eric) He's right about the snow.  We're blind.	VIKING BOB (OS)	 Ben?	CORBETT	 At least your girl had the sense to jump ship.  Too bad she's the only one small enough to fit through that dumb waiter.	Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 Your infrared camera?	ANNE MARIE	 (nods) Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.	ERIC	 I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.			Arctic Blue 
VIKING BOB	 There's what they're waiting on!	MITCHELL	 (smiles tightly) They'll have to come right past us.					Arctic Blue 
186  CONTINUED:		ANNE MARIE (OS)	 (over PA) They're moving toward you!					Arctic Blue 
ANNE MARIE (OS)	 (over PA) They're fanning out.	LEMALLE	 (to Viking Bob) Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?	VIKING BOB	 Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.	(CONTINUED)		Arctic Blue 
203  CONTINUED:		ANNE MARIE	 (gasping) Don't make me shoot.	ANNE MARIE	 (continuing) We're going to Sam's cabin.  You can stay in the jail until this is over.	LEMALLE	 Want to chance it with that hog-leg?  You can't even hold it up.  Better drop me first shot, bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin' lungs out.	Arctic Blue 
205  CONTINUED:		KENAI	 (disgusted) Lookit this damn mess.  Where in hell's Wilder?	NEFF	 (after a beat) Dead.  Trappers killed him.	KENAI	 Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble. (to Meyerling) What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?	Arctic Blue

(to Meyerling) What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?	MEYERLING	 Hey, I thought you people loved Corbett and his wild men!	Arctic Blue 
NEFF	 (after a beat) Dead.  Trappers killed him.	KENAI	 Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble. (to Meyerling) What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?	MEYERLING	 Hey, I thought you people loved Corbett and his wild men!	KENAI	 This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for business.  I'm sick of it.	Arctic Blue 
NEFF	 Well... two of the trappers are down already --	MEYERLING	 (suddenly on the bandwagon) -- One left; three of us.  Let's finish it.	NEFF	 What about Eric Desmond?	MEYERLING	 I'll handle him.	Arctic Blue 
LEMALLE	 (whispers) Over there...	MITCHELL	 (whispers) Hold it.  You might hit Ben.	LEMALLE	 Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming at.	MITCHELL	 Let 'em come closer first...	Arctic Blue 
MITCHELL	 Glad to see you're okay.  I told LeMalle not to shoot. (tries to smile) Had some fine seasons, didn't we...	CORBETT	 (to Eric) Fifteen years on the trail with this man, I never saw him rise to anger.	CORBETT	 (continuing; bitterly) Your first kill.  How does it taste?			Arctic Blue 
MEYERLING	 Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct? (no one argues) That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.	ERIC	 Fuck you.	MEYERLING	 This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.			Arctic Blue 
MEYERLING	 This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.	CORBETT	 (to Meyerling) Sure, when you put a bullet in my back on the way out.  Easier for all involved.	MEYERLING	 Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben. There's no room in Alaska for you any more.	MEYERLING	 (continuing) You're as antiquated as this shit.	Arctic Blue 
212  CONTINUED:  (2)		ERIC	 (continuing) Anybody moves and I'll shoot!	ERIC	 (continuing) Can you walk?	CORBETT	 Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.	Arctic Blue 
ERIC	 How come you didn't let him shoot me?	CORBETT	 (softly) Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.	ERIC	 We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.	(CONTINUED)		Arctic Blue
