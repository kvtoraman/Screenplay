I feel nothing but love for you.  We're a family.	JEFF (CONT'D)	 You want to pretend this isn't going to be a very big band.  Well it is.  You call yourself a leader of this band, but your direction allowed the t-shirt, when you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause he's your friend... don't you see?  The t-shirt is everything.  It's everything.	RUSSELL	 Is it my turn?  Because I think we should, for once, say what we really mean.	Almost Famous 
JEFF	 Oh, this is the part where you quit -	RUSSELL	 (stiffening) Right.  I'm so predictable.	JEFF	 No  I gotta tell the truth -- I want you to like me.

DICK (CONT'D)	 Alright, well, the rumors are true. The record company has sent a big-time manager here to try and talk you into replacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope. I know you've all heard of him.  He's got all the big bands.  He's right outside.  He wants five minutes with you right now.  I think we gotta do it.	RUSSELL	 (pissed) Then bring him in.	JEFF	 (arrogant) Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a rail!	RUSSELL	 (to William) We'll finish on the way to Boston. You can fly home from Boston.	Almost Famous

JEFF	 (arrogant) Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a rail!	RUSSELL	 (to William) We'll finish on the way to Boston. You can fly home from Boston.	DENNIS HOPE	 (completely unthreatening) Hi.	RUSSELL	 We already have a manager.  He's been with us from the beginning.	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 (to William) We'll finish on the way to Boston. You can fly home from Boston.	DENNIS HOPE	 (completely unthreatening) Hi.	RUSSELL	 We already have a manager.  He's been with us from the beginning.	DENNIS HOPE	 Respectfully.  We all have our roots. I believe in bands holding onto their roots.  But those roots need to be augmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth - I may enrage some and enthrall others. I don't really give a fuck.   Your manager here needs a manager.  Example. If you hadn't run out on the contract in Phoenix, you could have sued over Russell's hand... but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter... to electrocute you.	Almost Famous 
DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 We can all work together.  Your damages have put you way into the hole for this tour.  Right now you owe the record company more than you've got.  But your record's selling, there's money to be made.  So I've brought a plane in, we can add more shows to make-up the difference.   Respectfully.	RUSSELL	 (immediately) We travel by bus.	JEFF	 Doris is the soul of this band!  That bus has been our home since we were the Jeff Bebe Band.	DENNIS	 Hey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick if I thought we'd make more money. You can play more dates with a plane...	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 (passionate) Hey man, it's not about the money!  It's about Playing music, and turning people on!	DENNIS HOPE	 (delicately) Yes, of course.  Clearly. Respectfully.   But on the distasteful subject of money.  Just know.  You're making it -- right now -- and it's all --	DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 -- out there.  I'm just talking about bringing it --	DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 -- back here.	Almost Famous 
DICK	 But why should we pay you for something we can do ourselves?	DENNIS HOPE	 (immediately) Do you know how to keep from getting charged for the ice below the floorboards of Chicago Stadium? Do you know how to do a headlining tour, do you Claire Rothman at the L.A. Forum?  Do you know Bobbi Cowan, Lisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank Barcelona? (look around, amazed) This is Cleveland. Where's Kid Leo?? (basics) Do you know how you get a record not pressed but played?  Do you know?  I didn't invent the rainy day, man.  I just own the best umbrella.	DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 Because as much as you may believe that it will last forever, it does not last forever... your biggest fan right now soon they're going to go to college, gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money some other way, and you know what? (the final insult) They'll tape your record from a friend's copy.	DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 You've got to take what you can, when you can, while you can.  And you've got to do it now.  That's what the big boys do.	Almost Famous 
DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 Because if you think Mick Jagger will still be out there trying to be a rock star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly mistaken.	DICK	 (flustered) Yeah, well... we'll think about what you said.	DENNIS HOPE	 (casually) No no.  You don't understand.  I'll think about it.  I'm not auditioning. I came here to decide whether I want to represent you.  So I'll stand outside for a moment, and think about whether I want to stay.			Almost Famous

CLERK	 William Miller?  Sir, you have an urgent call from a Mr. "Ben Fong-Torres." He's holding for you, right now.	WILLIAM	 (deep voice) Hello.					Almost Famous 
WILLIAM	 I do.	RUSSELL	 (then pissed) Oh - get this - somebody told Penny Lane I sold her for beer.  The network of these chicks!  Like I would do that. It's Jeff who told her, right?

WILLIAM	 You guys -- you guys -- (beat) You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling Stone.	JEFF	 (tears welling, instantly) The cover of Rolling Stone.  And we made it together.  They don't just put somebody with one little hit on the cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine, man.  We made it.	JEFF (CONT'D)	 (continuing) Damn it -- I'm gonna enjoy this.  The first time I bought that magazine The Beatles were on the cover.  Four of them.  Four of us.  Together.	TOGETHER!		Almost Famous 
PENNY LANE (CONT'D)	 You're the last of my old-time friends. Polexia went to England with Deep Purple... can you believe that?  Even Sapphire's out someplace else.  All she left was her quaaludes.	WILLIAM	 Oh -- wonderful. (into phone) Front desk?  Please send a doctor. Room... what room?  703.  702.   Both rooms, either room.  This is Mr. Rugburn, Yes.

PENNY	 "Please place all stowable luggage in the overhead compartments... out in the seat in front of you."	WILLIAM	 (prompting) "Seat and tray tables."	PENNY	 "And seat-backs and tray-tables should be in their full and upright and locked positions... "			Almost Famous 
PRINCIPAL	 And to the class of 1973, we say -- (beat) Don't forget to remember yourself as you are today...  Full of hope... and the dream that everything is possible... Remember this, twenty years from now, when we all own home computers and we all travel in shiny electrical cars that move swiftly, high above the city... (beat) They key to the future is keeping today alive forever.	MRS. DEEGAN	 First.  Release the guilt. (Elaine nods) Second -	ELAINE	 Please let there be only two, because I can't get past Number One.	MRS. DEEGAN	 Second.  Leave a little room for the other teachers in this world.  He's out there looking for mentors.	Almost Famous 
PENNY	 "... you will be required to..." (gives up) I'm tired.	WILLIAM	 Well.  Now that I have your attention. And you may not remember this later, I just want to make it clear that... Hey! (she blinks, barely awake again) I know you've heard this before.  And I have never said this to anybody, not really - well, nobody who didn't legally have to say it back to me, but - (tries to be casual) I love you.  And I have a hard time sharing you with all of rock and roll because I - why am I nervous? - You'll never remember this - HEY! - (she blinks) I love you, and I'm about to boldly go where...  Many men have gone before...					Almost Famous 
DOCTOR	 However, she says you're her brother.	WILLIAM	 (eyes report) She's a little confused.	DOCTOR	 Nice champagne.	WILLIAM	 I don't have a driver's license.  With me.	Almost Famous 
PENNY	 (baring her soul) When I was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend took me to a Rolling Stones concert - and I freaked out and I rushed up to the front of the stage and then a thousand people had the same idea at the same time and I was getting crushed. And I couldn't breathe and that thought flashed through me - almost like a car accident - I thought I might die.  And it was in the middle of "Midnight Rambler" and Keith Richards saw me. And he came over, and came to the front of the stage, and he pulled me out. And they took me backstage and they gave me coke with ice and a - and a lemon.  And I never went home.	WILLIAM	 What about your Mom?	PENNY	 She always said - "Marry Up." Marry someone grand.  That's why she named me Lady.			Almost Famous 
PENNY	 She always said - "Marry Up." Marry someone grand.  That's why she named me Lady.	WILLIAM	 (horrified) She named you Lady?	PENNY	 Lady Goodman.	WILLIAM	 No.	Almost Famous

JEFF	 "Electrical storm?"	RUSSELL	 (strapping in for a roller coaster) Rock and roll.	RUSSELL (CONT'D)	 Wooooooo Baby!	CO-PILOT	 We're gonna try to land in Tupelo. We're going to have to cut the inside lighting for the next several minutes. We found a field to land in.	Almost Famous 
JEFF	 I can't breathe.	CO-PILOT	 It might be a rough set-down.  We should be fine. (cracking at the edges) But what we do say in a situation like this is - We would pass but before the plane ... disassembled.  However, God help us, if there's anything you want to say to each other, any secrets, anything like that, now would be a good time.  But just hang in there. We'll get you out of this.	DICK	 And everyone thinks it's so glamorous out here.	LARRY	 (oddly detached) He just told us we're gonna die.	Almost Famous 
DICK	 And everyone thinks it's so glamorous out here.	LARRY	 (oddly detached) He just told us we're gonna die.	JEFF	 (insecurities running wild) We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --	RUSSELL	 Shut up.	Almost Famous 
LARRY	 (oddly detached) He just told us we're gonna die.	JEFF	 (insecurities running wild) We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --	RUSSELL	 Shut up.	JEFF	 -- we can't even die in an original city!	Almost Famous 
DENNIS HOPE	 I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan. A hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on going.  I don't know if he's alive or dead, but I'm sorry.	LESLIE	 (gripped with fear) Oh my God.	DICK	 I love you all too, and you're my family.  Especially since Marna left me.  But if I ever took an extra dollar or two, here and there, it was because I knew I'd earned it.	RUSSELL	 I slept with Marna, Dick.	Almost Famous 
LESLIE	 Yes, but it didn't count.  It was the summer we decided to be free of all rules.	RUSSELL	 (to Jeff) And you say you "love me."	JEFF	 (the truth) I don't love you, man.  I never did.	RUSSELL	 Please.  Enough.	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 (to Jeff) And you say you "love me."	JEFF	 (the truth) I don't love you, man.  I never did.	RUSSELL	 Please.  Enough.	JEFF	 NONE of us love you.  You act above us.  You ALWAYS HAVE!!	Almost Famous 
JEFF	 You just held it over us, like you light leave... like we're lucky to be with you. And we had to live with it. I had to live with you, and now I might die with you and it's not fucking fair.	RUSSELL	 (to Larry and Ed) You hate me?  You too?	RUSSELL (CONT'D)	 All this love.  All this loyalty. (incredulous, giddy) And you don't even like me.	JEFF	 And I'm still in love with you Leslie.	Almost Famous 
LESLIE	 I don't want to hear anymore.    Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up!	RUSSELL	 (to Jeff) Whatever happens, you're dead.	JEFF	 Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not now.  You were sleeping with Penny, that groupie.  Last summer, and up			Almost Famous 
JEFF	 Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not now.  You were sleeping with Penny, that groupie.  Last summer, and up until yesterday.  Why don't you tell Leslie THAT?	DENNIS	 (freaking out) I quit.	WILLIAM	 "That groupie?"  She was a Band-Aid. All she did was love your band.  And you all -- you used her, all of you. You used her and threw her away.  She almost died last night, while you were with Bob Dylan.  You're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans. She was your biggest fan and you threw her away.  And if you can't see that, that's your biggest problem.	ED	 I'm gay.	Almost Famous 
WILLIAM	 Yep.	BEN	 (putting it all together) Oh baby.					Almost Famous 
FACT CHECKER	 Good 'cause it's going to take me three days to get through this research. It's all handwritten, on little slips. Plus, they all refer to woman as "chicks." I mean, as a woman I have a problem with that.  I know it's a side issue.	DAVID FELTON	 (sympathetic, loquacious) It's a "puff piece."  you fell for 'em.  It happens.  A relationship forms. You want them to like you. (wistful, chewing cigarette holder) Happened with me and Charlie Manson. He was a very charming... lively... charismatic...	DAVID FELTON (CONT'D)	 ... mass-murderer.	WILLIAM	 Please let me finish it.  Give me tonight to work on it.	Almost Famous 
FACT CHECKER	 Chet's piece is all fact-checked and ready.	JANN	 (to William) Get some sleep.  We'll do another story sometime.  We'll get you a kill fee.	FACT CHECKER	 His research is all on little bits of paper.  Did I say that?	WILLIAM	 Ben.  You told me to send what I had. It's not finished.	Almost Famous 
JANN	 Let him use the big office.   It's where Hunter used to write.	FACT CHECKER	 (pointed re: his age) You can type.	WILLIAM				Almost Famous 
WILLIAM	 (ruefully) Well, it was fun.	LESTER BANGS	 They make you feel cool.  And hey.  I met you.  You are not "cool."	WILLIAM	 I know.  Even when I though I was, I knew I wasn't.			Almost Famous 
WILLIAM	 Me too!	LESTER BANGS	 (leveling) The only true currency in this bankrupt world if what we share with someone else when we're uncool.	WILLIAM	 (distraught) I feel better	LESTER	 My advice to you.  I know you think those guys are your friends.  You want to be a true friend to them?	Almost Famous

RUSSELL	 So what?	JEFF	 So what? (beat) We come off like amateurs... some average band...  trying to come to grips, jealous and fighting and breaking up - we're buffoons!	RUSSELL	 Maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are.	JEFF	 He was supposed to be our friend.	Almost Famous 
JEFF	 He was supposed to be our friend.	RUSSELL	 (ruefully, remembering) I told him to write what he wanted.	TONY	 (to Russell) By the way, he has you on acid, screaming "I Am A Golden God" from a fan's rooftop.	RUSSELL	 (immediately remembering) Oh my God.	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 (ruefully, remembering) I told him to write what he wanted.	TONY	 (to Russell) By the way, he has you on acid, screaming "I Am A Golden God" from a fan's rooftop.	RUSSELL	 (immediately remembering) Oh my God.	JEFF	 They used him to fuck us.	Almost Famous

JEFF	 They used him to fuck us.	RUSSELL	 (still back at "Golden God") I didn't say "Golden God."  Or did I?	DICK	 We never took him seriously, and now it's serious.	RUSSELL	 I liked him as a person.	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 You.  You had the right idea all along.	DENNIS HOPE	 (nervously) How about the plane flight?	DICK	 It's all in there.  But don't worry, it's all unspecific who say what.  No names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences, it's just completely obvious who's who!  We're fucked!	RUSSELL	 I forgot he was there.	Almost Famous 
DENNIS HOPE	 Well, they haven't talked to Russell - he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker.  Then they can't print it.	JEFF	 (brightening) Is that true?	DENNIS HOPE	 It's war, my friend.  If you'd met me earlier, he would have never been on the around.	DENNIS HOPE (CONT'D)	 He'll live.	Almost Famous 
FACT CHECKER	 Russell Hammond is the one who denied it.	BEN	 (darkly) Crazy.	FACT CHECKER	 (one last shot, to William) We're going with the Who - !	SOMEONE'S VOICE	 He's just some fan... what did you expect?	Almost Famous 
BEN	 (darkly) Crazy.	FACT CHECKER	 (one last shot, to William) We're going with the Who - !	SOMEONE'S VOICE	 He's just some fan... what did you expect?	FELTON	 Well, I believe you.	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 What did I do?	SAPPHIRE	 Well - you can do what the big boys do. (he looks at her) Nothing.	RUSSELL	 Yeah.	SAPPHIRE	 You believe these new girls?  None of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak.	Almost Famous 
RUSSELL	 Is Penny okay?	SAPPHIRE	 The Quaalude Incident.  Yeah, it wasn't pretty.  She could have died.  I always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her.  I guess I was wrong. (shrugs) On of 'em saved her life.	RUSSELL	 Well, it's finally over with Leslie. I'm going to call her.	SAPPHIRE	 Let her retire. (he doesn't respond) You want to lock her up in a house in Michigan?  Please. (he doesn't respond) Write her a song someday.  She deserves it.  Something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of... (looks around backstage) ... pretty average people.  She deserves it...	Almost Famous

SAPPHIRE (CONT'D)	 (forward thinking) ... because something tells me twenty years from now, we'll remember her... and not much else.	DICK	 Have a good vacation.  I hope the band stays together.  Before it all went down the shitter, it was starting to get really good.	Almost Famous 
ANITA (CONT'D)	 You guys this is my brother!	MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT	 (ad if meeting a celebrity) "The Narc?!"	ANITA	 You guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I think I'm needed.	MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT	 Nice to finally meet you.	Almost Famous

ANITA	 (so worried) What are we going to do about him?	ELAINE	 I don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I just wish it could have happened to me.	ANITA	 The magazine killed his story.			Almost Famous 
BEN	 Well, we appreciate the visit.  The last time an artist came here, it was Buddy Miles and he punched me.	RUSSELL	 I'm not punching anybody.  I am personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self-reinvention.  This is about William Miller. (counting off fingers) He lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine... he smuggled about a half-pound of pot into Boston, and we never even told him -	RUSSELL (CONT'D)	 -- we told him too much, we told him everything...  He almost died with us over Tupelo... if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle... but you know, he tried to keep up, and that's a journalist to me.	JANN	 It's too late.  We're going with a different cover.	Almost Famous 
JANN	 It's too late.  We're going with a different cover.	RUSSELL	 (immediately) Thank God.	RUSSELL (CONT'D)	 You tell me it's too late.  But I could go back to my hotel room and... and O.D. tonight and something tells me you'd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue.  Am I right?	RUSSELL (CONT'D)	 I'm learning the game. (beat, shrug) We fucked up.  We made friends with him.	Almost Famous 
BEN	 Next time we'll all be more professional.	RUSSELL	 Maybe so. (beat, an odd thought) But God forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make. (rueful, to Hendrix on the wall) You might have died at the right time, my friend.	JANN	 Thank you for visiting.  Good luck.	RUSSELL	 Do what you want, but the story is true.	Almost Famous
