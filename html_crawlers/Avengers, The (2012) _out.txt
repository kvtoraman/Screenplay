NICK FURY	 Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.	AGENT MARIA HILL	 Yes, sir. (to standing agents) With me.					Avengers, The (2012) 
(IN ENGLISH)	 You may have to write it down. Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.	WEASELLY THUG	 Ya? (looks at LUCHKOV) It's for you. LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.	LUCHKOV	 Who the hell is...	AGENT PHIL COULSON	 You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby. HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her back.	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.	PEPPER POTTS	 (on the other line) You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid? INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.	TONY	 Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.			Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 Which is why he can't stay.	AGENT PHIL COULSON	 We need you to look this over. (he holds out a file towards	STARK)	 Soon as possible.	TONY	 I don't like being handed things.	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 Yeah.	PEPPER	 You mean if you finished? (Stark nods his head) Well, um...then... She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks away in embarrassment.	TONY	 Square deal. It's the last date. Pepper kisses him.	PEPPER	 Work hard. As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in holograph form, worried.	Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 Only word I care about.	BANNER	 (takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this.	STEVE	 Well, this is actually kind of familiar.	NATASHA	 Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath. Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly "sail."	Avengers, The (2012) 
BANNER	 Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?	TONY	 It's a stabilizing agent. (walks in with Coulson; to	COULSON)	 I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.	TONY (CONT'D)		Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY (CONT'D)		(TO THOR)	 No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants.	(TO CREW)	 Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks	AROUND)	 How does Fury do this?	Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 You think Fury's hiding something?	TONY	 He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it?	BANNER	 (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...	STEVE	 Doctor? A beat.	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it?	BANNER	 (bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...	STEVE	 Doctor? A beat.	BANNER	 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.	Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 I heard it.	BANNER	 (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.	STEVE	 The Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York?	BANNER	 It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?	Avengers, The (2012) 
BANNER	 (pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.	STEVE	 The Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York?	BANNER	 It's powered by Stark Reactors, self- sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?	TONY	 That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.	BANNER	 (referring to Tony) So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?	TONY	 I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.	STEVE	 (taken by that) I'm sorry, did you say...?	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.	STEVE	 (taken by that) I'm sorry, did you say...?	TONY	 Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry?	STEVE	 Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?	Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 (taken by that) I'm sorry, did you say...?	TONY	 Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. (holds out a bag of blueberries) Blueberry?	STEVE	 Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?	TONY	 An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.	Avengers, The (2012) 
(SMILING)	 And you're all about style, aren't you?	TONY	 (a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?	BANNER	 Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier, shakes it off.	STEVE	 Just find the cube. Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility, he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.	Avengers, The (2012) 
BANNER	 Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.	TONY	 You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.	BANNER	 But you can control it.	TONY	 Because I learned how.	Avengers, The (2012) 
(SITTING DOWN)	 Tell me.	NATASHA	 (she pulls up a chair as	WELL)	 Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh...well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skillset. I didn't care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.	LOKI	 And what will you do if I vow to spare him?	Avengers, The (2012) 
(LAUGHS)	 No, you brought the monster.	NATASHA	 (turns back around; poised) So, Banner... that's your play.	LOKI		(STAGGERED)	 What?	Avengers, The (2012) 
BANNER	 We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.	TONY	 And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2? Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.	STEVE	 PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons.	(TO TONY)	 Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow.	Avengers, The (2012) 
(TO TONY)	 Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow.	NICK FURY	 (trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're...	TONY	 I'm sorry, Nick. Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of THE WEAPONS.			Avengers, The (2012) 
BANNER	 Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.	NICK FURY	 Because of him. (pointing at Thor)	THOR		(STUNNED)	 Me?	Avengers, The (2012) 
NATASHA BANNER	 Are you all really that Captain America is on naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential threats? watch list?	TONY STEVE	 (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one You're on that list? Are you more crack... above or below angry bees? Threatening! I feel threatened! As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's scepter is glowing brightly.					Avengers, The (2012) 
NICK FURY	 You need to step away.	TONY	 (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?	STEVE	 (pushes Tony off) You know damn well why! Back off!	TONY	 (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 (puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?	STEVE	 (pushes Tony off) You know damn well why! Back off!	TONY	 (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.	STEVE	 Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?	Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 (pushes Tony off) You know damn well why! Back off!	TONY	 (comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.	STEVE	 Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?	TONY	 Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.	Avengers, The (2012) 
(SMILING)	 Always a way out... You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.	TONY	 (that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!	OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER	 The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points right at the engine. Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.			Avengers, The (2012) 
AGENT MARIA HILL	 Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is down! Can we get a run in? (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER) Talk to me.	GALAGA PLAYER	 (points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air.	AGENT MARIA HILL	 We lose one more engine, we won't be. Somebody's got to get inside and patch that engine.			Avengers, The (2012) 
NICK FURY	 Get his attention.	AGENT MARIA HILL	 (on her EARPIECE) Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN SHUTTLE! Don't get too close.	ESCORT 606 PILOT (V.O.)	 Copy.			Avengers, The (2012) 
NATASHA	 Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head. CLINT BARTON Thanks. (Natasha unfastens the	RESTRAINTS)	 Tasha, how many agents?	NATASHA	 Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.			Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?	TONY	 (turns around sharply) WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!	STEVE	 Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...	TONY	 (looking at the blood stained	Avengers, The (2012) 
STEVE	 Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...	TONY	 (looking at the blood stained	WALL)	 He made it personal.	STEVE	 That's not the point.	Avengers, The (2012) 
AGENT MARIA HILL	 Those cards, they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket.	NICK FURY	 They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards) A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying off as well as the QUINJET.	NICK FURY	 They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything.	AGENT MARIA HILL	 Yes, sir.	Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 THE AVENGERS. (Loki looks at him, confused) It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing.	LOKI	 Yes, I've met them.	TONY				Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.	LOKI	 (slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you? Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing. Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.	LOKI	 It should work.	TONY	 Well, performance issues. You know? In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across the room.	Avengers, The (2012) 
THOR	 Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?	LOKI	 (tries to look away) It's too late. It's too late to stopit.	THOR	 No. We can. Together. Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.	LOKI	 Sentiment. Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of CHITAURI follow his lead.	Avengers, The (2012) 
(AT HAWKEYE)	 You think you can hold them off?	HAWKEYE	 Captain. (pulls a trigger on his bow; a narrow is mechanically	CHOSEN)	 It would be my genuine pleasure. HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge, followed by an EXPLOSION. Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH. HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it. People begin to run out. BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.	BLACK WIDOW	 Just like BUDAPEST all over again!	Avengers, The (2012) 
IRON MAN	 Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS. IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.	CAPTAIN AMERICA	 Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal. Slow them down. You've got the lightning. Light the bastards up. (Thor flies up; to Natasha) You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.	THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH		UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL		Avengers, The (2012) 
CAPTAIN AMERICA	 Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.	BLACK WIDOW	 Well, maybe it's not about guns. (gestures the flying	CHARIOTS)		CAPTAIN AMERICA	 You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride.	Avengers, The (2012) 
BLACK WIDOW	 Loki's scepter.	SELVIG	 It might be able to close the portal. (Selvig looks down. He sees a	GOLD GLEAM)	 And I'm looking right at it.			Avengers, The (2012) 
TONY	 Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.	THOR	 (looking up at Stark Tower) We're not finished yet. A beat.	TONY	 And then shawarma after.			Avengers, The (2012)
