Omega Man Script





I Am Legend













This is a copy of the 1st revised draft of Omega Man, back when it was still titled I Am Legend. I obtained a copy of this script from a charity auction for retired actors; the script was signed by Charlton Heston and Producer Walter Seltzer.





I AM LEGEND Screenplay By John William Corrington  First Draft: 6/26/70 Revised: 7/18/70         Property of Walter Seltzer Productions Inc. Warner Bros. Studios         I AM LEGEND   FADE IN:  WIDE ANGLE MED. LONG SHOT  WE SEE a palm-lined richly attractive street in a Los Angeles suburb. The houses are set back from the street; the street itself is quiet, empty -- except for a few cars parked in front of the houses. While the camera takes no notice, the tires are down on the parked cars, the lawns of the houses are uncut. A Ford experimental model convertible turns corner INTO VIEW. It drives at a medium speed.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR - HEAD ON  ROBERT NEVILLE is driving car. He wears sunglasses, a sport shirt, a neckerchief, and looks altogether like a wealthy man out for a drive. CAMERA ALLOWS CAR TO PULL ABREAST, so that SHOT BECOMES SIDE ANGLE. As the CAMERA ENTERS passenger space of the car, we HEAR MUSIC, "Everybody's Out Of Town." Neville hums along with it. He seems at ease, unconcerned. We SEE the houses on his right side passing by. Then his humming stops, his jaw tightens. The car stops with vicious suddenness, and CAMERA PULLS BACK to MED. SHOT, as if aghast at the sight to follow. Neville, in a single motion of astonishing speed, comes up with a sten gun in his right hand, fires directly INTO CAMERA.   REVERSE SHOT - DARKENED BALCONY WINDOW OF HOUSE  CAMERA ZOOMS IN from MED. LONG to MED. CLOSE SHOT of a deeply shadowed window in one of the houses. Bullets smash into the frame of the window, tear out chunks of the stucco. We SEE, barely, a figure fall backward. We cannot see any details of the figure. Its presence is more intuited than seen.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE  IN F.G. is Nevilles sten gun, almost obscuring his features. FREEZE-FRAME.  CUT TO:   CREDIT MONTAGE  A rapid series of SHOTS as titles begin. Title of film is not shown now but held to the last frame of the film. Titles begin with star names, etc. and are distributed over following scenes except where noted.    ALIEN MISSILE being raised to point toward sky.  FACE OF CHINESE SOLDIER twisted with anger, SCREAMING.  TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS READING NEWS   MATTHIAS ... the Sino-Russian border war continues to escalate, according to...   ANOTHER MISSILE RISING. Under this and subsequent FLASH CUTS there should be the constant CRACKLING SOUND of RADIO transmissions in Russian and Chinese.   MEETING ROOM with a small number of officials angry, frightened. On the wall behind there are crossed red flags, a portrait of Lenin.   ANOTHER MISSILE. We HEAR, overlapping one another, Chinese and Russian VOICES counting down almost together from ten to one like a chorus of doom. Missile is fired SOUND BREAKS OFF.   FLASH CUTS OF SERIES OF ATOMIC BLASTS, one after another, each one a slightly CLOSER SHOT, garbled RADIO TRANSMISSIONS under SHOTS -- including French, Russian, Chinese, British and American accents.   BRITISH  ...totalyes, totalno survivor  (break)The embassyterrible...   AMERICAN Jesus, Jesus Christ...you never (break) ...Vladivastok ... nothing ... nothing...   INT. OMAHA SITUATION ROOM with giant illuminated wall-map of world, various equipment, military personnel sitting at consoles. In F.G. a YOUNG OFFICER is leaning across a desk, speaking to OLDER OFFICER. In his face is real fear.   OFFICER  Theyve ... gone ape, Sir ... gone ape...   As he speaks, WE HEAR the CRACKLING ground-bass of radio TRANSMISSIONS, cut, broken. "Condition Yellow ... Yellow Alert ... Attention ... Yellow Alert..."   ZOOM SHOT - PAST OFFICERTS FACE TO ILLUMINATED WALL MAP  At edge, we begin to SEE RADAR-STYLE BLIPS approaching North American continent from East. Radio transmissions increase in intensity, volume, and in the GARBLED HYSTERIA, which is just below the voices. "Condition Red ... Red... Red ... Bogies on screen ... origin ... What is origin? What is origin?... Asia ... no, Jesus, from all over. They're both ... we see... both of them are ...   PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES IN SPACE  SOUND is killed for this and similar SHOTS. Alien missiles apparently motionless in space with the earth turning very slowly below.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - ANTI-MISSILE MISSILES being raised, fired.  CLOSE SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIAN  in Omaha Situation Room. He is monitoring anti-missiles as they head for incoming missiles. Radio transmissions again: "...two minutes thirty to initial intercept. Tracking is...ninety seconds to initial...   PROCESS SHOT - ANTI-MISSILES IN SPACE  showing anti-missiles zeroing in on the much larger alien missiles. SOUND OFF. WE SEE some of the small missiles about to hit the larger ones.   MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS  at consoles. CAMERA PANS TO WALL MAP showing small blips conjoining with the large ones6 SOUND SUDDENLY. "Abort antis ... repeat abort.... configuration..."    MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS  They frown at one another, one shrugs. SOUND: another VOICE, "Impact... Impact... score mounting. Impact on thirty percent of incoming ... now fifty-one point six. Impact.."   PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES COLLIDING   MED. SHOT - MILITARY TECHNICIANS  as they hear the transmissions, their expression of nonunderstanding turns to one of panic. SOUND: Initial VOICE, "Abort firings. Missiles do not conform to nuclear-configurations. Repeat, abort firings. Do not intercept. Non-nuclear attack underway ... Repeat, non-nuclear attack underway.  PROCESS SHOT - MISSILES EXPLODING  Color of explosions should be geared to the color of water in the plaza fountain, which is perhaps illuminated by CAMERA orange and red and yellow spots under the water. IMAGE BLURS at explosion.  CAMERA MOVES DOWNWARD from explosion, picking up earth far below, keeps going down more and more rapidly, finally BLURRING In speed.   VERY HIGH SHOT - SHOPPING CENTER  CAMERA is still going DOWN, less rapidly. This SHOT seems to follow out of preceding one. At first, we SEE the shopping center, then SHOT CENTERS at the sidewalk In front of a single store. It is a Saturday afternoon, hundreds of people milling about, many oars moving. SHOT-finally NARROWS down on a single man walking out of store. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT. Man looks vaguely troubled, then panicked, grabs his eyes, his head CAMERA MOVES IN for a VERY CLOSE SHOT of his face, then his mouth alone as he opens It to give a blood curdling HOWL of agony and fear.   VERY CLOSE SHOT - CAR STRIKING POLE  The driver is dead or dying. His car veers crazily into another car, ends up striking pole.  TV ANNOUNCER - IN THE CLEAR MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS ... the entire Los Angeles area. Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain and Civil Defense authorities state that the situation is much the same...   MED. SHOT - TV SCREEN - IN THE CLEAR - MATTHIAS  from between heads of two people watching TV. We watch the screen and then, as fragment of news reporter's story is cut off, CAMERA REVERSES showing people watching are dead, eyes, mouths open.     MATTHIAS ... across the entire country. Martial law is now nation-wide. Whether a state of war between China and Russia -still exists is not important any longer. Our fellow countrymen are dying. The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble...   CLOSE SHOT - RADIO  It is a small transistor on a counter in a filling station. As CAMERA PULLS OUT showing station deserted, cars stopped here and there, a man and woman dead in a convertible at the gas pumps.    ANNOUNCER ... CONELRAD channel. This is a class one emergency. All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways. Stay in your homes...   CLOSE SHOT - RADIO IN POLICE CAR  We SEE the receiver, HEAR the emergency message as CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing a policeman lying, eyes open, across the steering wheel of the car.   ANNOUNCER Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution ... Repeat This is a...    LONG SHOT - DOWN A H0SPITAL CORRIDOR  As the CAMERA PANS HALLS, WARDS, ETC., there are, here and there, a few bodies in the hallways, the beds are full.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - IN THE CLEAR - NEVILLE IN LABORATORY  Neville sits at his desk in white lab coat, sign on desk says COLONEL ROBERT NEVILLE. He is watching a small TV on his desk.   MATTHIAS so now the question is survival. Is this the end of technological man? Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays, the boasts of science, the superhuman conquests of space and time... the age of the wheel?  Neville grimaces, shakes his head. At the end of next speech PHONE RINGS.    MATTHIAS We were warned of judgment. Well, It's come now. This is the Judgement, the weeping and  gnashing of teeth... Oh, God, where will it end...?   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE ON PHONE  nodding, face set.   NEVILLE Yes. Soits airborne bacteria. Let's try-vaccine 93-b-71. How the hell do I know? I don't... It might. Ill be there in an hour.  NEVILLE RUNNING DOWN CORRIDORS  with small satchel.  NEVILLE ON AIRSTRIP running toward waiting helicopter. He wears fatigue coveralls.  NEVILLE IN AIRBORNE HELICOPTER with satchel of vaccine in lap. PILOT next to-him.  ZOOM SHOT - TO PILOT  grabbing eyes, falling forward onto controls.   HELICOPTER GOING DOWN  Neville showing signs of illness too.   HELICOPTER CRASHED  Neville drags himself from wreck. Only one bottle of vaccine is unbroken. He injects himself, passes out.  LAST TITLE  FADE OUT.  FADE IN:  MED. LONG SHOT - INT. DARK TRAVEL AGENCY  from rear of office. There are posters on the walls: "See Mexico." "Visit London," "TWA to Hong Kong," etc. Dust is over everything, the floors are filthy and-, littered with paper. CAMERA points out OPEN DOOR to street. Suddenly we SEE Neville FLASH by in his car.  CUT TO:  LONG BOOM SHOT - DOWN ANGLE ON EMPTY STREET  from roof of building. In left F.G. WE SEE clothesline. Clothes hanging on it are bleached. have begun to fall apart. We HEAR in DISTANCE ' high-pitched ROAR of Neville's ENGINE. Then he races by in street below.  CUT TO:  MED. SHOT - DESERTED SCHOOL ROOM  CAMERA points out OPEN WINDOWI- with a broken blind hanging alongside. In left frame, next window has Easter bunnies, eggs, etc. made by children. In right side of frame, teacher's desk with small flag, rotten apple. Again, SOUND of CAR, Neville passes outside.  CUT TO:   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  As he rounds corner, he sees things lying scattered in the street ahead. He tries to stop, but runs over them.   CLOSE SHOT - TIRE GOING FLAT   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE GETTING OUT OF CAR  He is irritated, looks around as if seeking a filling station attendant in order to get tire fixed. Glances down. He has run over a broken steel box, with US Mint markings. Its torn hinges have shredded the tire, and the gold ingots it contained are scattered under the wheels. He glances across street. A Brink's truck sits crashed into a fire hydrant, its rear doors open, swinging useless in breeze. Mint boxes and gold bullion lying unguarded.    MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  His expression is one of total disgust. He speaks sardonically.   NEVILLE  Why don't they keep the goddamn street clean.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  He unloads car, hangs gun over his back, puts a few grenades in his belt, lifts gas can. As he walks away from car, he muses.    NEVILLE  There was a Mercedes agency on Sunset. Or was it Wilshire?   MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING  Ahead is the agency. Windows are broken. A 230SL convertible sits in the showroom. Neville walks through the broken window, walks around car.   NEVILLE The color's not right, but ... how long did you say it takes to get a new one from Germany...?  He walks to another car.   NEVILLE  How about this one? One careful Pasadena driver in tennis shoes?  What's her phone number?   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE SERVICING CAR  He has put in battery, gas, etc. He closes hood, gets in. Glances at watch.   NEVILLE  My God, is it that late?  He guns the motor and drives out through the broken window.  CUT TO: .  WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  We see Neville speeding down an empty main thoroughfare, the car accelerating faster and faster. He makes an impossible turn, the car bottoming, righting itself, fishtailing, straightening out and zooming on.  CUT TO:   WIDE ANGLE SHOT - A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE  A long DOWN SHOT, which shows the car reaching speeds of over a hundred miles an hour.  CUT TO:   VERY CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  This is HEAD ON. Nevilles concentration, his tension must show. He looks like a master-driver in the ultimate test of his career. Meanwhile, it is getting darker, closer to night.  CUT TO:  WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  CAMERA RUSHES IN as SHOT OPENS, to MED. SHOT of the car careening down a deserted street in absolute recklessness. As Neville nears the end of the street, he slightly sideswipes a car parked out from the curb.   VERY CLOSE SHOT - TIRES AND LOWER SECTION OF CAR  Tires squeal as Neville turns corner. CAMERA MOVES OUT TO MEDIUM SHOT as car rights itself and shoots away.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN CAR  The car lights are on now, and as Neville slows down, it is deep twilight. He turns into drive in front of a tall apartment building. CAMERA MOVES IN TO MED. CLOSE SHOT of Neville in car. He presses remote-control button and WE SEE garage door open ahead of him. CAMERA SWIEEPS to Neville's face. He shows relief, as if he has made, It through a very tough race indeed.  MED. SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM BEHIND CAR  As Neville guns motor and starts into garage, a figure detaches itself from growing darkness and leaps onto him. The figure seems simply to materialize) and it leaps high, landing almost in the car. Neville tries to fight back as the car drifts down the drive into garage.   MED. SHOT - INT. GARAGE  from within the garage. WE SEE the car drifting down the ramp into garage, Neville and the black-clad figure wrestle as the car, at low speed, crashes into a pillar or another car. Neville pushes the black figure away, hits him, hits him again, jumps from the car with his sten gun and fires a burst into the black figure. CAMERA RUSHES IN FOR CLOSE SHOT OF NEVILLE as he turns from the fallen figure. He looks outward at the still-open garage door, his face reflecting fear, horror.   REVERSE SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA  Two more black-clad figures are rushing in armed with clubs or spears.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  CAMERA JERKS as Neville fires his sten gun directly into LENS. Above the gun, his face is clenched in hatred, loathing.   MED. SHOT - GARAGE DOOR AREA  The door is lowering now. There is a body lying in a dark heap-just inside. WE can SEE one or two others scurrying away outside in the dark as the door closes4   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  He has lowered his gun, holds the remote-control box, pressing the button to lower the door. He is exhausted, shoulders slumped. He walks through the garage stopping to check a large gasoline-powered generator that has been jury-rigged to a panel to distribute current. There are shelves full of oil and batteries and similar supplies. He walks through the low-lighted garage. There are several rows of bright automobiles, sports cars, jeeps, a few pick-up trucks, a single armored car. All are kept in good condition, brightly polished.  Neville walks back out into the open area of the garage, surveying the damage to the Mercedes, shaking his head.   NEVILLE  That's a shame. So hard to get a repairman these days, too.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT ELEVATOR  Neville unlocks an elevator, gets in and pushes the button for the top floor.   NEVILLE  Penthouse, Robert. He's probably anxious to get on with the game.  He leans back against the side of the elevator, eyes closed, exhausted, but still on the verge of laughter.   NEVILLE  Some game...  CUT TO:   LONG SHOT - ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING - NEVILLE  The elevator opens directly into penthouse. Neville coming OUT into his fortress-apartment. In left F.G. of SHOT is silhouette of profile of what appears to be a man in a military--cap. Neville drops sten gun slowly to the floor, looks around room, his eyes light on figure.   NEVILLE  Okay, Okay, Im ready.  CAMERA MOVES PAST SILHOUETTE, MOVES ACROSS LARGE ORNATE CHESSBOARD in middle F.G. to MED. SHOT on Neville-. He pulls off dirty shirt, tosses it aside, walks to his left. CAMERA STAYS ON HIM.   NEVILLE  Go ahead ... move.  Neville walks into what seems another world, as CAMERA TURNS to FOLLOW HIM. It is a very long gallery-like room with many mahogany bookcases, walls covered with major paintings, pieces of sculpture here and there. He walks to a beautiful and ornate bar-liquor-cabinet, takes down a bottle of fine scotch. He pauses and studies the label as he twists off the cap. He speaks back over his shoulder.    NEVILLE  Why dont you have a belt? It might improve your game.  He takes a long pull from the bottle, then moves on to the far end of the room where we can SEE a beautiful bed, armoire, old fashioned wash-basin, mirror, etc. These are perhaps screened off from the rest of the long gallery area by some bookcases set at right angles to the wall, forming a small chamber behind. CAMERA STAYS at ENTRANCE to SMALL CHAMBER. Neville rummages for a clean shirt, slips it on.   NEVILLE  But tonight you're going to lose. Luck over skill...  CAMERA MOVES IN QUICKLY FOR CLOSE SHOT showing that beneath is sardonic humor, Nevilles loneliness and isolation tell on him.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He still carries glass, and is rummaging again, this time in a storage cabinet. It is white, antiseptic, very large. It contains a multitude of canned goods. Neville gets out a can of beans. He moves to stainless steel refrigerator, also large, gets out a summer sausage, and ice cubes and a chilled glass for scotch.   NEVILLE  You hear all that downstairs? I let sundown catch me out.  So he took the gambit and threw away a few pawns. I was lucky...  Neville opens can, cuts casing off one end of sausage. CAMERA moves OUT to MED. SHOT, showing this opposite end of apartment. It is as stark, barren and utilitarian as the other end is cultivated and civilized. In it are kitchen facilities, laboratory equipment, and a massive arsenal. (See Appendix for more on apartment)   NEVILLE  From time to time he gets nervous.  He smells the end game coming...  Neville is looking toward center of room as he talks. CAMERA MOVES BACK so as to place chessboard once more in middle F.G.  Neville is walking toward board, scotch bottle and glass In one hand, beans (with spoon in can) in other. Summer sausage Is slang across his shoulder, held by string looped over finger of hand holding beans. He saunters to board, looks down studying situation. We now have time to SEE that the board, and its pieces, are both large and superb: a museum-quality set.   NEVILLE But end games are fall of surprises, arent they? Ummm. My move, and discovered ... check!  He puts down beans and sausage on edge of table, and moves knight, revealing check from his queen on opponent's king. Neville smiles and sits down.   MED. SHOT - ACROSS BOARD - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW  We find that his partner is a bust of Caesar propped in the chair with an old and badly battered garrison cap on it. Cap bears eagle Insignia of colonel. CAMERA MOVES TO TWO SHOT. Neville studies board, absently presses a switch located under the table. After a moment, we HEAR MUSIC. It is Frankie Laine singing "We'll Be Together Again."    RECORD No tears, no fears, we both have a lifetime before us... So what if we have to part, we'll be together again...  Neville hits reject switch. Another tune, instrumental COMES ON. "Harlem Nocturne," Ted Heath's orchestra; alto sax solo.   MED. SHOT -NEVILLE AT CHESS BOARD  Neville makes a move on board. As he does, we HEAR NOISE, COMMOTION outside. Breaking glass, yells. Neville stands, studying board Intently. As the noise INCREASES, CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE SHOT of his FACE. His jaw tightens at he tries to Ignore the SOUNDS.    ZACHARY (O.S.)  Come out, Neville  Neville sighs, smiles at bust.   NEVILLE  Excuse me, won't you. Just for a moment.  He walks quietly to window, reaches down and picks up a Springfield 1903 rifle with a Sniperscope attached. He steps to the window. The windows are full-length and open onto a narrow balcony. All along the balcony rail, spaced every thirty feet or so, are floodlights pointed down into plaza in front of building. Neville has knocked out partitions between portions of balcony so as to have access to flood lights all along building. Down below In plaza or courtyard, there Is a large and brightly illuminated fountain, water bubbling In it, cascading from level to another. Neville stares out over darkened city. In far distance, perhaps a mile away, we SEE a fire start up, blaze higher.  REVERSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S SILHOUETTE IN WINDOW    NEVILLE They're at It again. Burning, wrecking. I wonder what tonight? A library? A laboratory? Maybe they've found the Museum of Fine Art. Goddamn those crazy bastards...   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE AT WINDOW  He raises the rifle.  LONG SHOT - INFRA-RED TELESCOPIC SHOT  PANNING weird and unreal area outside range of floodlights. Passes a hunched, squatting figure. Stops, moves back Crosshairs glow as sight is given fine adjustment. IMAGE RECOILS as we HEAR REPEAT OF RIFLE. Figure slumps. MORE NOISE, CONFUSION, CRIES.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  SHOT is across chessboard, through pieces from busts POINT OF VIEW. Neville is grinning sardonically. He raises the rifle in salute.   NEVILLE Hall Caesar! And what do you suppose Brother Matthias is going to say about that?  CUT TO:  MED. LONG BOOM SHOT - NEVILLE AT TABLE  SHOT is from outside window. CAMERA IMMEDIATELY PULLS BACK farther and farther until we SEE Neville's penthouse, a circle of brilliant light in an ocean of surrounding darkened buildings, no street lights. CAMERA HOLDS when penthouse is only a small glimmer of light. (Matte)  DISSOLVE TO:  CLOSE SHOT - FIRE IN FOG.  Fire flickers as CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that it Is made 'up of burning books. CAMERA PANS titles: Molecular Biology, Astrophysics, etc. In B.G. we see many members of the Family systematically wrecking scientific and computer equipment.   MATTHIAS (O.S.)  Three? You're sure? Not three.   ZACHARY (O.S.) Three, Brother. Two were inside the garage when he brought down the door, We heard the shooting. Then Joshua...  CAMERA TURNS RIGHT, bringing Matthias INTO FRAME, CLOSE SHOT, head and shoulders. Matthias has dead-white hair, complexion, wears enormous sunglasses with reflecting lenses.    MATTHIAS  The light, you have to stay clear of the light...  CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Zachary. He Is like Matthias, white with sunglasses. But his hair Is natural and his features clearly African. Zachary speaks defensively.   ZACHARY  Brother, there wasn't no light...  That cat hit Joshua in pitch black...   MATTHIAS  He cant see in the dark-...anymore than we can In the light.  Zachary shrugs.   ZACHARY  Go tell him. Brother. He sees good enough, dark or light.   Matthias walks in the glare of flames, wrecking continues In B.G. His dialogue is delivered sadly, reasonably at first.   MATTHIAS one creature... caught in a place he can't stir from in the dark. One lone man...   ZACHARY  He aint a man, Brother.   MATTHIAS No, no, you're right. But he is alone, outnumbered hundreds to one, with nothing to live for but memories ...nothing to live with but his gimmicks and gadgetry, his guns and ears...and yet the whole Family cant bring him down out of that...that...   ZACHARY  Pig-paradise, Brother?   MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND ZACHARY  Matthias smiles sadly.   MATTHIAS Forget the old ways, Brother, the old hatreds, the old pains. The Family is one...  Zachary nods, matching Matthias grin.   ZACHARY  Hog heaven, then...  But Matthias is getting worked up.   MATTHIAS Its not a joke, Brother. Remember the word! That thing, that Neville, is a creature of the wheel! He uses forbidden weapons, to6.ls! He has the power of Hell In those evil things!   CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY  He is agitated, tired of hearing this. He has told them before that he can bring Neville down. He tries again.   ZACHARY  Well, let me put the power on him. Look...  CAMERA FOLLOWS his pointing finger. In a glass-fronted refrigeration unit are flasks of nitroglycerin. CAMERA SNAPS BACK to ZACHARY.   ZACHARY ...or there's cannons. I can go to the old Guard armory. I could get a rocket-launcher ... Just turn me loose...  MED. SHOT - GROUP - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY  We SEE that a group of five or six others who are like Matthias have gathered around while others continue destruction in B.G. The group mumble amongst themselves, shake their heads.  Matthias answers him, as if he were explaining to a child.  MATTHIAS  Oh, yes, Brother, you could do that.  Any one of us could. But if we did,  The curse would begin once more,  don't you see that?  CLOSE SHOT - ZACHARY  Zachary is sullen.    ZACHARY  I see that bastard living In the light like God whilst we rot and hide down  here like grubs ... What do you reckon will happen if he hunts as out while  We sleep?   MED. GROUP SHOT MATTHIAS, ZACHARY, OTHERS      MATTHIAS  Put it out of mind, Brother. He will be destroyed.  But not by guns and explosives. They are forbidden.  They are never to be used again. When we have cleansed  the word the flood of our righteousness will sweep it all away...  As Matthias speaks he picks up a book and hurls it toward the fire, knocking elaborate glass structure down.   MATTHIAS And Neville will be brought down... down to the Family and judgment. For blasphemy, for murder...  As he speaks SLOW DISSOLVE from fire, grown larger now, engulfing whole building behind, to brightly lit top story of Neville's apartment.'  VERY LONG SHOT TOP STORY OF NEVILLE'S APARTMENT  FADE OUT       FADE IN:  MED. LONG SHOT - EMPTY STREET, EARLY MORNING  The street is one of those with many apartment-hotels, etc., as on portions of Wilshire Blvd. SHOT is through trees, grass is tall in the-lawns, etc. We HEAR NOTHING at first but BIRDS. Then we HEAR the SOUND of someone RUNNING. CAMERA TURNS, finds a LONE FIGURE RUNNING TOWARD IT. SHOT. should be made INTO RISING SUN, sun rays refracted and diffused around dark silhouette of figure.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING  He is in sweat suit, the shirt has JOHNS HOPKINS in large letters on front, his sten gun is on sling over shoulder, canteen and pouches in utility belt at waist. Flashlight, knife, etc. There is also a small tape recorder hung on belt. Neville continues to run, looking from time to time at numbers on buildings. At last he stops in front of a building, inspects it. He is breathing hard.   NEVILLE ...And Big Bob Neville shakes off the last of the tacklers and scores with fifty thousand fans tearing up the stands... Another six for Hopkins...yea. Neville.  He squats, pulls map from pouch, studies it, speaks into small tape-mike. CAMERA MOVES OUT FOR MED. LONG SHOT OF NEVILLE, down ANGLE from building POINT OF VIEW.     NEVILLE This is 6306 Rimini Boulevard, sector two. The last six blocks have been clean. In the 5500 block, some signs they'd been foraging for food in a small drive-in grocery. (sardonically)  You'd think prices would keep them in the super markets.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He unlimbers sten gun, checks it, sets it down, checks flashlight. Then he opens canteen, squats and drinks. Assumption is, it's whiskey. He gargles a little, spits it out, studies the building narrow-eyed. Talks into recorder.   NEVILLE You've got to hand it to the bastards. They cover their tracks. It's been a damn year now.  Drinks again, lets mike-hang, eyes distant in thoughts   NEVILLE If I could find the nest, find where he stays thered be an end-run, and an end game, sure enough...  He gets up, closes canteen, picks up equipment.   NEVILLE But what would I do then...?  CUT TO:   SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE SEARCHING  He moves through dark corridors, into rooms. He is very efficient in his checking, spending only a few moments in each place.   MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM  Dark, dusty, light falling through half-closed blind. SHOT is ACROSS BED. Neville kicks open door, sees bed. There is someone or something apparently in it. Neville jerks back sheet, sten gun ready.   CLOSE SHOT - CORPSE IN BED  The body, left from plague-time, is not a skeleton, but simply a decayed and desiccated ruin, disgusting and piteous.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLETS REACTION  He is sickened, his raised adrenaline draining away.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN BASEMENT  He probes in comers, closets. Obviously is well practiced at this "search and destroy" technique.  . MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN OFFICE BUILDING  He is moving. rapidly through offices, dust everywhere, files, etc. scattered. He always checks closets, etc.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING DOWN  His eyes narrow, he leans over and reaches down into wastebasket.   REVERSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - NEVILLE ABOVE   MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He lifts up a sardine can, oil drips from it. Neville smiles viciously.  CLOSE SHOT - WASTE BASKET  In it are empty bottles, trash. It is not dusty or old looking.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AT DOOR OF OFFICE  Door is large, paneled. Obviously the entrance to very plush executive office. Neville puts ear against door, listens, stands back, kicks door open.  LONG SHOT - OFFICE - PAST NEVILLETS SHOULDER  It is paneled. drapes, dark furniture, thick carpets, etc. It is very long with a huge ornate desk at the far end. Behind the desk, sitting in a large high-backed swivel chair is a body. Neville studies the figure in the chair for a moment. The figure wears a hood, and it is this which keys Nevilles response. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN ROOM toward figure. CAMERA now in Neville's POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA GLANCES FROM SIDE TO SIDE as it approaches figure, making sure there are no others lurking in corners. CAMERA STOPS on MED. SHOT, figure in chair, it stirs.   NEVILLE (O.S.)  All right, Dracula. Wake up. You've got company.   Figure does not move. WE SEE BARREL of sten gun poked toward him from BOTTOM OF FRAME. We cannot see eyes of figure.   NEVILLE (O.S.) Where's Matthias? Where does he stay?  Figure does not move. MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE He shrugs, sighs.   NEVILLE  I always ask, and I always get the same answer (beat)  Once more: where's the hive? Where does the king bee stay?   MED. CLOSE SHOT - FIGURE IN CHAIR  As Neville finishes speech, he pokes figure with barrel of gun. It falls forward, hood coming off. It Is dead and Disintegrating. SHOT HOLDS. We HEAR Neville's VOICE into tape recorder.     NEVILLE (O.S.)  6806 Rimini Boulevard, sector two.  Found another. Matthias' crowd is dying  from the plague, one by one. Sweep continues.  DISSOLVE TO:  FADE IN:  LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING ALONG STREET  He walks, one hand in pocket, a sten gun In the other, window-shopping. Some of the windows in the stores are broken. Behind others, the displays are askew, dusty. A liquor store Is almost demolished. He reaches an expensive looking clothing store, pauses, walks inside. Dialogue Is VOICE OVER. He palls off sweatshirt, drops it on floor.     NEVILLE You dumb bastard, why did you ever bother to wash these things? Youre the only consumer left in town.  CUT TO:  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE IN MENIS CLOTHING DEPARTMENT  He takes a garment from the rack, looks at it, drops it then frowns, picks it up and re-hangs it on the rack. He draws out a beautiful brocade tuxedo jacket, turns it, smiles, hangs it back.   NEVILLE  The Officers club is closed, isn't it?  Permanent undress is the correct uniform.  CUT TO: LONG SHOT - NEVILLE WALKING THROUGH DARKENED STORE  Away from windows, it is shadowy in-the store, and we watch Neville walking, some clothes over his arm. SHOT is PAST HEAD AND SHOULDER OF A MANNIKIN.  CUT TO:  LONG SHOT - THE SAME - ANOTHER ANGLE  Again POINT OF VIEW of a manikin -- as if those inert figures are watching Neville's progress past them. He seems unconcerned, but his sten gun is in his right hand.  MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE   THIS SHOT is from between the upraised arms of a manikin.  CLOSE SHOT - FACE OF MALE MANIKIN CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER MANIKIN  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE  He has stopped in relatively light portion of store. He is looking up, face filled almost with reverence.   MED. UP ANGLE SHOT - FEMALE MANIKIN  This manikin wears a very brief bikini. She is remarkably life-like. Her hips jut forward provocatively, her eyes point down toward Neville, and her long brown hair falls about her tanned shoulders. She wears the smallest of smiles.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING UP AT MANIKIN  This SHOT is past the head and shoulder of another manikin across the aisle from where Neville stands.  It is as if his moment of passion and remembrance is overseen.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE - SIDE VIEW  He is I still looking upward. He puts out his hand to touch the almost-flesh of the manikin. Then, suddenly, there Is a small indefinite SOUND. He pauses, his jaw tightens. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO MED. LONG SHOT  as Neville whirls, sten gun up, clothing dropped. He is about to fire.   MED. SHOT - GROUP OF MANNIKINS AND LISA  These are female manikins including some with Negro features, In various dress, various poses. CAMERA FINDS LISA AMONG THEM, MOVES IN SUDDENLY TO MED. CLOSE SHOT.  WE SEE the "manikins" mouth open In horror.  MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW - LISA  Lisa turns suddenly and vanishes Into the shadows of the store.   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE  He is petrified. He cannot believe what he has seen. The gun hangs useless in his hand.  He stands thus for's long moment, then, finding his voice, he calls after her.   NEVILLE  Wait...come back...wait...  Youre real! Youre not...  LONG SHOT - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH STORE  Again, this SHOT is through a group of male manikins, well dressed, grinning at Neville as he runs.   MED. LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEVILLE RUNNING  He gets another glimpse of the girl as she runs out a side door of the store.  MED. SHOT EXT. STORE  This store is across the street from a large park. Neville pauses outside the store, looking up and down. CAMERA RUSHES BACK TO VERY LONG SHOT, still focussed on Neville. When CAMERA STOPS, the SHOT is FRAMED by the girl's hair and one shoulder. We do not see her face, but we can tell she is looking back at Neville from within the park. CAMERA ZOOMS IN on Neville again as he sees the girl. He begins running across the deserted street toward her.  SEQUENCE OF SHOTS - NEVILLE RUNNING THROUGH PARK  In none of these shots do we see the girl again. We see Neville running through trees, past a lake or stream; pausing to get his breath ' looking in all directions. He is almost frenzied. It has been almost two years since he has seen a normal human being alive -- much less a lovely girl. As the sequence ends, he is obviously exhausted. The shadows are much longer now. It is afternoon.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE SEATED ON BENCH  He sits, head down, his gun beside him. He is beginning to wonder if he has hallucinated the girl, if at last he is slipping toward insanity.   NEVILLE  Does it begin this way? Is two years alone too much?  Then his head comes up. He has control again.   NEVILLE No. you silly bastard, it doesn't begin this way, and two years alone is all right. The way it begins is asking yourself idiot questions. Now, let's find a drink before it's time to go home.  He stands up, stretches, looks refreshed.  DISSOLVE TO:  CLOSE SHOT - CANDLE GUTTERING IN HOLDER  CAMERA PULLS BACK, showing Neville in bar mirror. He drinks from glass, pours a little more from bottle, turns from-the bar. The room Is dark, light coming only from candle and from windows at front. The door is open. Neville, sten gun in left hand, drink in right, walks through tables, stands at door. Across the street is a federal court building. His eyes go up its height as CAMERA TURNS for LONG SHOT of BUILDING, Neville In RIGHT SIDE of FRAME.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE BACK INSIDE  He puts down empty glass, starts to pick 'up his equipment. Suddenly pauses as he HEARS a CRASH from a breaking bottle. His jaw tightens, he becomes tense and turns toward sound.  CLOSE SHOT - WINE KEG DISPLAY  Sign reads "Visit Our Wine Cellar -- For the Experience of a Lifetime"   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE He squints at sigh, heads for the stairway with candle. MED, SHOT - NEVILLE GOING DOWN STAIRS WITH CANDLE  MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CELLAR  This should be a spooky and generally tense atmosphere. The cellar, like much contemporary commercial architecture is made to look like an "authentic" wine cellar, and two years' dust and cobwebs have improved on art. SHOT is from BEHIND wine rack, over bottles, showing Neville at foot of steps, looking about cautiously. He puts candle on hogshead for general lighting, pulls out flashlight to examine  MED. REVERSE SHOT - WINE RACKS, NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW   MED. LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE LOOKING AT WINE RACKS  His flashlight probes here and there along walls. Stops on a. particular area of one of the racks.   VERY CLOSE SHOT SIDE VIEW OF WINE BOTTLES IN RACK  Neville's light falls on bottle. Behind rack we SEE another HAND at back. CAMERA HOLDS. The hand is still when light first strikes it, then it comes to life, moves, clenches.  MEDIUM SHOT - BEHIND RACK OF BOTTLES  We SEE a FAMILY MEMBER who has apparently been sleeping in cellar and has knocked wine bottle over in sleep. He comes awake fully as Neville enters cellar.   NEVILLE - CLOSE SHOT   From the shadows to his left rear. Also made from behind wine rack. CAMERA RISES from near floor level to five feet or so, following POINT OF VIEW of Family member.   MED. WIDE ANGLE SHOT - WINE RACK  From behind Neville. As he approaches rack, the entire Rack tilts and slowly falls toward him.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  throws himself back, trying to avoid the rack, but as he does so, he looks up.   MED. CLOSE SHOT - UP ANGLE - CREATURE ON TOP OF WINE RACK hood flaring behind, arms outstretched CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION  MED. SHOT - RACK FALLING ON NEVILLE  bottles falling out of rack and exploding on floor. Creature jumps free from top of rack,  MED. LONG SHOT - DOWN ANGLE FROM STAIRS  Three more of the creatures pile-out from behind barrels, wine racks, wherever they've been sleeping. MED. SHOT NEVILLE UNCONSCIOUS UNDER WINE RACK CLOSE SHOT CREATURE'S FACE  Shook as CAMERA SNAPS IN for very CLOSE SHOT: dead white face, Its mouth open, twisted with hatred and anger, eyes still obscured by hood.  FADE OUT.  SLOW FADE IN:  As light begins to fill the SCREEN again, BLURRY, without FOCUS, WE HEAR, as from a great distance,  TINY in sound, the VOICE of Matthias once more. He is preaching in away not much different from his last TV appearance in the credit montage. His voice has a peculiar mixture of the comforting and the sinister in it. As  he goes on, his voice RISES, moves toward HYSTERIA.           MATTHIAS-  ...and, oh, brothers and sisters, I ask  you to look at him. Does he have  the Marks? Do you see them?  (muffled answers  of "no, no.")  You see him as we were before the  Punishment, before we gained grace.  You see lying there, the last of  scientists and bankers and business-  men...the users of the wheel! Do  we use the tools of the wheel, as  he does?  ("no, not.")  Is he of The Family?  ("no, not")  Is he of the Sacred Society?  (no, not.")  Then ... what is he?  (confused mumbling,  anger)  CAMERA CLEARS VERY SLOWLY TO AN UP SHOT NEVILLE's POINT OF VIEW  WE SEE the vague image of someone in robes in a high pulpit, behind a high bench. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY, APPEARING TO SEEK FOCUS. THEN IT SNAPS INTO FOCUS IN ZOOM - VERY CLOSE SHOT of large reflective sunglasses. It is Matthias. His hood is pushed back, and the rooms illumination is quite low. He seems to float in the darkness with candle-flames flickering around and behind him.  LONG DOWN SHOT - NEVILLE TIED ON FLOOR MATTHIAS POINT OF VIEW  Neville is regaining consciousness. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN on him as Matthias talks.   MATTHIAS (O.S.) He is part of the dead...he has no place here. He has the stink of oil and electric  circuitry about him. He is obsolete... ( ...yes, yes.")  WIDE ANGIE SHOT CHAMBER IN FEDERAL COURT BUILDING  Its former function should still be evident, but it-now serves as the place where the Sacred Society governs the Family. It is courtroom, meetinghouse, church of the group. It is dark, hung with black cloth. The room is full of the hooded creatures that we have seen before. Only Matthias and perhaps half a dozen of his immediate followers do not wear hoods. Their hair and skin is dead white, their eyes are covered by an assortment of shields.    MATTHIAS  And what shall we do with old machinery...?  ZOOM CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW He points at Neville.  MATTHIAS  ... you are discarded. You are the rubbish of the past...  MED. CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE His initial horror and fear past, he LAUGHS aloud.   NEVILLE This is a bloody Halloween party... Youre all sick ... You need...  Those nearest, knock him back down, silence him.   MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS  He smiles, shakes his head. His voice becomes soft with false compassion. He leans down over his pulpit.   MATTHIAS How hard it is to admit the truth. (beat)  Take him to the little room. For the Questioning... MED. SHOT - CREATURES DRAGGING NEVILLE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they take Neville into a smaller room.   MED. LONG SHOT - THE LITTLE ROOM - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE  This room resembles the small chambers in which private questioning took place during the Inquisition. The table is long and there are candles and books on it. The scene should be Gothic and just this side of a put-on. Taste here, as elsewhere, must be exquisite so as to tread the line between the grotesque, the demented, and the Camp.   MATTHIAS  Well, now, Mr. Neville, we can talk for a little while. It's been a long time since you've talked -- except to yourself.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION  Neville is surprised. He has assumed Matthias was truly and completely insane.   NEVILLE So you dont rant all the time? Why bother with it at all?  MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS He LAUGHS, walks around the dark room.   MATTHIAS Yes, you were a scientist. The kind of man who understood nothing until there was almost nothing left to understand.   NEVILLE (surly) I'm getting along...   MATTHIAS You're getting dead, Mr. Neville -- or doctor or colonel, whatever they called you. I have responsibility for the last tiny remnant of mankind ... I have that responsibility.    NEVILLE Then why the hell dont you live up to it? Why don't you throw away the costumes and get these people organized, try to work on a cure... Matthias turns on him angrily.  MATTHIAS Oh. we are organized. You know that well enough. A cure? There is none. In the early days ... Have you seen the ruins of the general hospital? Thousands of bodies littering the corridors, rooms jammed with the dead ... and finally... those pitiful few who were left, hopeless, going mad, lynching the doctors, the technicians who had betrayed them... By the way, why weren't you there... Doctor?  REACTION SHOT - NEVILLE    NEVILLE I tried. There was a crash...  TWO SHOT - MATTHIAS AND NEVILLE,     MATTHIAS It doesn't matter. There was no cure. Is none. The curse you people created, couldn't stop, is... forever. So Ive turned that curse into a blessing.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION   MATTHIAS (O.S.) No. now the Family has found its way. It can bear the burden -- the only curse left is -- you.   NEVILLE You are insane. And before very damn long, youll be dead -- can't you see that?  CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS  (angrily) last night you killed how many? Three of us? And today We don't know yet. And before that? You've killed dozens...Youre the messenger of death, Doctor, not us.    TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND MATTHIAS  OTHERS come INTO the room now, and Matthias manner changes. Once again he adopts the portentous pose of judge-prophet.   NEVILLE I was defending myself ... You lunatics came after me...   MATTHIAS He's confessed all, Brothers. Murder, use of forbidden tools, practice of proscribed rites. He admits 'science, medicine, weapons, machines, electricity. He has not shared the Punishment; he does not bear the Marks...   CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE   NEVILLE What is the Punishment? The Marks?  WIDE ANGLE GROUP SHOT - MATTHIAS AND GROUP OF FAMILY  As Neville speaks, the group stares at him. This is the first group appearance of the Family. WE SEE that they are of both sexes and all races. Some seem fairly young, however there are no children. In addition to the hoods, we find some wearing goggles, some helmets with dark visors, etc. Obviously, all these forms of eye guards have been scavenged in the empty city.   SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS - INDIVIDUAL FAMILY MEMBERS  As CAMERA PANS from one to another, each removes his or her glasses, goggles, etc. revealing blank white eyes. CAMERA completes pan, stops on Matthias. He removes glasses, shows his own white eyes. For the first time, WE SEE the OPAQUE EYES of the Family.   MATTHIAS  (quietly) These are the Marks, Mr. Neville ... The Punishment is what you and those like you brought upon us...  CAMERA CLOSES on Matthias, closes slowly on his face, eyes, as he talks.   MATTHIAS In the beginning, we tried to help one another, those that were left. We tried to clean things up, set them straight. We buried and burned. And it came to us that we were spared for just that work...   PAN SHOT - FAMILY MEMBERS LISTENING TO MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS (O.S.)  ... to bury what was dead, to burn what was evil, dangerous...  Neville's VOICE breaks in harsh, angry.   NEVILLE (O.S.) So you burned libraries, laboratories...You wrecked computer centers, engineering facilities ... a herd of insane barbarians. Every night you go on burning.   PAN SHOT ENDS ON MATTHIAS. He still speaks very quietly.     MATTHIAS You call us barbarians, Neville'. Very well, it's an honorable name. We mean to cancel the world you made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons began to threaten more than they offered.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE    NEVILLE  You'll play hell...   CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS No, you've played hell you and your dead kinsmen of the car and the plane and the tank and the bomb ... and when you die, the-last living reminder of hell will be gone ... forever.   As he speaks, CAMERA PULLS OUT TO GROUP SHOT. The Family RS assent.  Matthias turns to Zachary.   MATTHIAS Brother Zachary?   ZACHARY We got everything ready.   MED. SHOT - EXT. - NEVILLE, MATTHIAS, ETC.  An alley or narrow street. There, a cart has been brought. It has high sides and two solid wooden wheels about five feet in diameter. It is filled with old newspapers, books, files, broken pieces of wooden furniture, etc. SHOT is made BETWEEN Neville and Matthias. Matthias and Family have glasses or shields back on. Zachary comes over, jerks Neville roughly toward cart. Matthias stops him.   MATTHIAS  One thing, Neville, now that its over...  Neville stares back at him.   MATTHIAS  why didn't you leave? Why didn't you get out of the city...?   NEVILLE  I wasnt sure about that ... until now.   MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE IN CART  On his head is a conical cap obviously made of computer printout paper. This scene echoes the burning of heretics. Again, if it is done tastefully, it will gather still another fragment of the past which haunts us. Neville is bound in the small cart. It is pulled by members of the Family. HOWLING members of the Family throw rubbish at him -- scientific debris -- and curse him. The cart is in the midst of a dense crowd, each member of which carries a candle. The lighting is weak, bizarre.  CLOSE SHOT OF OLD WOMAN in hood, eyes opaque, LAUGHING insanely, throwing objects at Neville.   CLOSE SHOT - HANDS  trying to reach through the slats of the cart to scratch Neville. They are dead white.   MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE  over a wave of candles, the flames flickering Insanely.   LONG SHOT - THE CROWD  filling a narrow street from Neville's POINT OF VIEW.   CAMERA TRANSITION TO NEVILLE  who stands tied to the cart, wood and paper and books piled around him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT. We find that we are in a VAST EMPTY STADIUM. In the midst of the field, THE FAMILY, all carrying candles, are gathered around the stand from which Matthias preaches. The cart has been turned upside-down and the technological debris it contained is piled below one of the wheels, to which Neville Is bound, spread-eagled. It stands in a large circular burned area. This is where Matthias and the Family have burned bodies after the plague's onslaught.   MED. LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW   MATTHIAS  Here Is evil...  MATTHIAS past Neville's profile. As Matthias speaks, CAMERA FOCUS ALTERS FROM  MATTHIAS to NEVILLE.    MATTHIAS  Is this not the place where all the dead burned? And this (pointing to Neville)  Is the last of the dead...And what will we do with this corpse?  As Matthias asks his question and the Family HOWLS for Nevilles death, CAMERA PULLS OUT VERY QUICKLY TO WIVZ ANGLE LONG SHOT as stadium LIGHTS COME 0N. At first flickeringly, then with a BURST of fall power. All the lights do not come on. Some bulbs ate burnt out or have failed over the  past year or so, but still the field la flooded with light.   MED. SHOT - MATTHIAS AND OTHERS OF THE SOCIETY  falling back from their stand, trying to cover their eyes despite their sunglasses.   MATTHIAS  (surprised)  What...?   NED. LONG - CROWD SCENE  Family members dropping their candles, falling, groping, trying to find a way out of the blazing arc lights.   CLOSE SHOT - FAMILY MEMBER   writhing on ground in agony.   MATTHIAS (O S.) Find the switch, get those lights off...! Give us the darkness again! More dark ... more dark!  NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER  stumbling blindly toward sidelines of stadium.  NED. CLOSE - FAMILY MEMBER  trying to stab Neville, missing him In his blindness.   WIDE ANGLE LONG SHOT - STADIUM  Neville still staked out in center of stadium. Last of the creatures Is crawling or hobbling away out of the light. After a long moment the are-lights begin to fade, wink, and finally go out. CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN TO CLOSE SHOT of Neville struggling, trying to get loose. Then he pauses, fear in his expression, He HEARS someone COMING.  NED. SHOT - BLURRED IMAGE OF SOMEONE MOVING ACROSS FIELD  walking swiftly across the empty field, Neville tries to twist his head around to see, but it is too dark down in the bowl of the stadium to see more than a shadowy figure.    CLOSE SHOT - HANDS UNTYING NEVILLE - SEMI-DARKNESS  WE SEE HANDS quickly loosening the ropes on Neville's ankles and hands.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE'S POINT OF VIEW  Shadow of someone above him.  MED. SHOT'- NEVILLE FREEING SELF FROM ROPES He pulls loose from the last rope.  NEVILLE  Who are you?   Dutch (O.S.)  Shut up. Move, move, MOVE!  Neville begins to run, pushed by the shadowy figure.  SEQUENCE OF SHOTS:  MED. CL0SE - NEVILLE  running to edge of field.  MED. LONG - NEVILLE AND FIGURE  running into ramp area, disappearing under stands.  MED SHOT - NEVILLE  Figure behind him pushes him along in the darkness, giving him no pause.  LONG SHOT MATTHIAS AND FAMILY RECOVERING FROM LIGHT  Matthias and his people are re-grouped, looking for Neville.  CLOSE SHOT - MATTHIAS   MATTHIAS  Find him. Search the Corridors...  the storerooms...everywhere... CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE  Figure behind pushes him through a door, slams it closed. Neville falls to his knees, shakes his head, trying to get his bearings. A beam of light from an electric  torch sitting on a box dimly illuminates the room. He rises, starts to turn. Then, from shadows behind  him, between lockers he HEARS:   LISA (O.S.) All right, son of a bitch. Just hold tight... (beat) Uh-uh, dont turn. Stand. When I want you turned, Ill turn you. on or off or around.  Lisas voice is low, smooth, sophisticated, but there is in It the sound of a profound self-confidence.  MED. LONG SHOT - NEVILLE - REAR VIEW AGAINST LIGHT  Lisa slowly drifts INTO FRAME LEFT. FOCUS is on Neville. Lisas head, right shoulder are blurred. Her hand comes up holding a .45 automatic. FOCUS MOVES TO GUN, Neville still In B.G.   LISA  Thats fine. Now put your hands out... way out, shoulder high.  Like they were going to crucify you.   CLOSE - NEVILLE  looking AT CAMERA, his head and shoulders in LEFT HALF OF FRAME. In shadows behind, WE SEE LISA vaguely, the .45 VIVID in SHAFT OF LIGHT from torch.   NEVILLE As a matter of fact, they were going to roast me. Why did you stop them?  Lisa comes closer. We can SEE HER. She Is beautiful, and black. She Is wearing a shirt, tails tied,  and long shorts, with cycle boots. Her face is composed, almost amused as she moves up behind Neville.    LISA  We've got a reason,  Neville's eyebrows rise. He is setting himself to turn on her.    NEVILLE  My name is Robert...   LISA  Your name's mud, Mister.  Neville whirls, CAMERA FOCUSES on Lisa who lifts the .45, brings it chopping down with moderate force.  MED. TWO-SHOT - NEVILLE AND EISA  Lisa is breathing a little harder, but her composure is fine. She cooks pistol. Neville is getting off floor staring  into muzzle of .45, rubbing his head, looking at the girl with grudging respect.   LISA  ...and youre not going to need  a name if you fool with me again.  She nudges Neville toward the door. He raises his hands automatically. They walk.   NEVILLE Where did you pick up that cute  way of saying stop?  WE SEE LISA still behind, looking from one side to the other as they traverse corridors.   LISA  Oakland. I was a Raider. Anyhow,  I only said slow. You know how I  say stop?  The pistol nudges Neville's ribs. Neville keeps walking.   NEVILLE  You keep clowning around, and those  spooks out there are going to...   LISA  Shut up. Dutch is taking care of the honks.  LONG SHOT - FROM CORRIDOR OF STADIUM LOOKING OUT ONTO FIELD    WE SEE MATTHIAS' PEOPLE running closer toward the corridor, This shot, we discover, Is from POINT OF VIEW of the shadowy figure, Dutch, who now stands in darkness. WE HEAR Dutch fumbling with something. CAMERA FOCUSES now on F.G. Dutchs hand rises, holding cylindrical container. Matthias' people still in B.G. reach corridor entrance. Dutch throws container.  REVERSE SHOT - CORRIDOR FROM MATTHIAS' POINT OF VIEW  As they try to enter, there is a blinding explosion of LIGHT, only moderate SOUND, as a phosphorus grenade explodes. SHOT should capitalize on diffusion, refraction of phosphorus blow-up, its brilliant blue-white glare.  MATTHIAS  No, no ... get back ... The next entrance...  MEDIUM TWO SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA  Neville is in F.G., Lisa behind with pistol. They are trotting.  LISA  okay... stop, Open it up.  They are standing near a utility room. Neville turns and sees her for the first time.   NEVILLE Youre..!  LISA  Okay, you've seen me before. Pull it out buster ... move!  Neville wheels out a small motorcycle,   NEVILLE  (admiringly)  You plan ahead...   LISA We plan every which a way. Now look, you're gonna ran this thing, but I'm the ramrod, you know?  Neville says nothing, seating himself on the bike.   LISA Do me a favor, will you? Don't screw up. I know how to roll, Out It's hard on the elbows ... and oh, yeah, If you just have to play James Bond, I'm gonna sift your brains All over the walls,  Neville grins In spite of himself.   NEVILLE  Yes, ma'am...  CAMERA PULLS BACK as he, starts cycle and they move OFF down shadowy corridors.   LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY IN CORRIDOR  They tan along corridor, seeking Neville. SOUND of bike can be heard   MED. CLOSE SHOT - CANISTER ROLLING INTO MATTHIAS' PATH  As we see another grenade appear, we HEAR Alts laughter from side corridor. Grenade explodes,  spurting burning phosphorus onto one of Family. CAMERA PULLS OUT to MED. SHOT as Family  member SHRIEKS in pain.    MATTHIAS Down the other way. We'll catch them at the main exit ... the ramp.   SERIES OF SHOTS - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE IN CORRIDORS  Lisa yells directions to him as Neville skids bike around corners, in and bat, around obstacles like heaps of  cushions, piles of coke cases, etc, Shot should take advantage of bike light, refractions, shadows, veering of  bike, near collisions.   LISA  Left, left, goddamn It.  (beat)  Another leftand step on it.  LONG SHOT - RAMP OF STADIUM  Shot is from Dutchs POINT OF VIEW. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing Dutch, standing about ten yards  from ramp. He holds a grenade In each hand. It is still dark, but the first signs of pre-dawn are APPEARING. We HEAR the roar of the Family as they run inside the corridor toward ramp. As they APPEAR, Dutch lofts the first one and then the other grenade, tossing one on each side of the exit, leaving a narrow passage directly in the middle, free of the phosphorous, though bathed in blinding LIGHT. Matthias and Family fall back in confusion.  We HEAR sound of bike over their yells, Dutchs laughter.   MED. SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA ON BIKE  They skid around final corner. Neville hits brakes, Leaves rubber.   REVERSE LONG SHOT - DOWN CORRIDOR, NEVILLVES POINT OF VIEW  Matthias and his people, turned and blinded by burning phosphorus, HEAR Neville coming.

He revs engine, kicks off straight toward Matthias and Family.  LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW  We see Matthias and the rest coming closer and closer as SOUND of bike becomes deafening Behind Family is burning phosphorus. Matthias Puts out his hands as If to wave Neville to a stop.   MATTHIAS Stop them, stop them...  FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S FACE.  LONG SHOT - MATTHIAS AND FAMILY NEVILLES POINT OF VIEW Shot MOVES RAPIDLY closer to Family.   FLASH CUT - CLOSE SHOT - LISA,'S FACE   LISA Down the middle, right down he middle!   MEDIUM SHOT - SIDE ANGLE - COLLISION OF BIKE AND FAMILY  As bike flashes through them, some of the Family try to stop Neville. Bike veers, rights, sails through, knocking Family members in all directions,   MEDIUM-SHOT - BIKE GOING BETWEEN PHOSPHORUS GRENADES  Neville manages to steer down slot between the two bombs Dutch has thrown. For a moment, the bike and its riders are bathed in weird glow of phosphorus. Howls of disappointed Family can be heard.   LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE ON BIKE DUTCHS POINT OF VIEW  They roar down ramp and into empty parking lot. CAMERA PULLS BACK showing Dutch in F.G. cranking up his own bike, laughing exultantly at the success of the escape. He watches Neville and Lisa race away, and after another look in the direction of the stadium where the grenades still burn, he follows them.   LONG SHOT - CYCLE ON FREEWAY - FRONT ANGLE   MED. SHOT - SIDE ANGLE - LISA WITH ARM AROUND NEVILLE  She has left arm around his middle, gun in right hand aimed into ribs. Yells Into his ear:  LISA Take the next exit...  As they reach exit, Neville wheels the bike suddenly. Lisa has to grab him with both hands. He plucks gun from her hand, lowers the hammer as they speed down off-ramp. Lisa Yells:   LISA You sneaky bastard  Neville LAUGHS, hands her back the gun. She sticks it into her belt and puts both arms around him at they go off onto country road.    DISSOLVE TO.    MED. LONG DOWN ANGLE SHOT - NEVILLE AND LISA  They pull up in front of an apparently deserted house perched on the edge of a canyon. Neville leans the bike on its stand, stretches, turns.  MED SHOT - LISA  She is holding gun on him again, smiling broadly.  MED. SHOT - NEVILLE  He scratches his head.   NEVILLE  Well, I'll be damned. I thought we'd gotten past that...  CAMERA PULLS OUT TO TWO SHOT    LISA  Youre sweet. Now just walk on up to that house.   MED, LONG SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE WALKING TO HOUSE  SHOT is THROUGH OPEN WINDOW next to door through which they will pass. Window looks dusty, drapes faded, torn. As Lisa and Neville approach door, CAMERA PULLS BACK across barrel of Thompson submachine gun and hands holding it, revealing that SHOT is from GUNMANIS POINT OF VIEW.  MED. SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE WALKING INTO HOUSE  It is moderately dark In house. Neville rubs his eyes. SHOT is still ACROSS GUN BARREL. Neville sees gunman. Lisa moves up beside him.     LISA  It's all right, Tommy. This is the Man.... I mean THE Man....  but he's tame.   REVERSE SHOT - TOMMY  He Is a small Chinese boy of about twelve who holds the machine gun nervously pointed at Neville, He smiles at Lisa, frowns at Neville.   TOMMY What are you gonna do with him, Lisa?    GROUP SHOT - LISA, NEVILLE, TOMMY.     LISA (to Neville) Have you got any idea what Tom would have done If you'd come up to this house carrying my .45?  Neville nods.   NEVILLE Im beginning to get an idea.  CAMERA PULLS OUT as others walk into light. They have been waiting to see what was happening.    LISA  This is the crop...  There are perhaps six or eight young people about evenly divided between boys and girls. The others, except for Lisa and her brother, are white.   LISA  all there is. At least that we know of. There are others around,  I guess... If Matthias and his nuts havent killed them all.  Neville is astonished. The kids seem healthy, alert.   NEVILLE  I didnt know there were...any.  LISA (sardonically) Between Matthias and his goons at night and you In the daytime shooting anything that moved, we stayed low,   NEVILLE I was staying Alive,  The others exchange glances,   LISA  If you call that living.  Neville Is Irked. He did not come for a seminar In ethics. Then there is the SOUND of a motorcycle outside, All turn, toward the door,  TOMMY  Its Dutch...  He runs toward door, Lisa and the rest follow, Neville in rear.    MED. SHOT -DUTCH  He climbs off cycle, drops kickstand. He wears a leather jacket, a air of pearl-handled .45  automatics on his hips. Saddlebags are staffed with grenades, a Thompson submachine gun, etc. Dutch also wears goggles, an old World War I style helmet, riding breeches and Jack-boots. His  hair is long, and on the back of his jacket is painted the upraised red fist of revolution--with the middle finger extended. He is a tough cookie, but very bright indeed. Tommy and Lisa WALK  into picture.  LISA  Hey, it's the mad bomber. Where you at, baby?  Dutch pulls off his helmet, smiles at Lisa, ruffles Tommy's hair. CAMERA MOVES OUT to include others in GROUP SHOT. Dutch looks at Neville.  DUTCH  I see you got my partner, the mad doctor, here all right.  CLOSE SHOT - NEVILLE'S REACTION   NEVILLE  You know who I am?  CAMERA MOVES OUT to GROUP SHOT   LISA  Dutch knew about you. He knew your work...  Neville looks astonished.   NEVILLE  My work...?

DUTCH To somebody poisoning your well.  Neville grins.  NEVILLE Where did you pick up on that?    DUTCH Med school, I was a senior when they scratched the whole world. I was going to  apply to Biowar Labs for a post-doc, but the next term never came.  Neville is surprised, touched. NEVILLE I'm sorry you didn't make it.   LISA If you all are done with the mutual admiration, you reckon we can go on Into Richie?  NEVILLE Richie?  They walk toward house.   DUTCH  Lisas brother. He looks like  hes about to go over.  CLOSE SHOT NEVILLE He frowns uncomprehendingly.   NEVILLE  Go over...?   TWO SHOT- DUTCH AND NEVILLE  They have reached house now head down hall into darkened bedroom.  DUTCH Oh, that's right. You've only seen the tertiary cases ... Were primary, you see.  Neville is stunned. It simply has not occurred to him that the young people are also victims of the plague.    DUTCH When it hit, the older people either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast. You know: blindness in light, albinism, psychotic delusions, occasional stages of torpor: like Matthias and his gang.   NEVILLE And you?   DUTCH Some of the younger people had a kind of resistance. We...hold out. One or two of us are a little bit light sensitive, but otherwise all right. But Richie's going. He's advanced secondary.  GROUP SHOT - AT DOOR OF BEDROOM A girl comes out. LISA How is he? GIRL (shaking head)  No better. The color is gone from his skin, Lisa. Hesalmost white.  Lisa shakes her head.  LISA  If he wasn't out of his head already, thatd really blow his mind.  Dutch laughs without humor, lights a candle. They step INTO darkened room, close to bed. They look down to see a BOY lying on bed, tossing. His skin Is light- not dead white, but very light--though his features are African. His hair is natural, but also light His eyes, when he opens them, are white, but only iris is missing. Pupil is still visible. Neville leans down over him, studying him. This is our first chance to see Neville as Doctor.   LISA Well...?   NEVILLE Shut up.  SERIES OF SHOT - NEVILLE AND RICHIE  He goes over Richie carefully, checking vital signs, blood pressure, reflexes, etc.   DUTCH (O.S.) He could hold here for weeks and then come up one of Matthias' monsters--or he could go over in ten minutes.    NEVILLE (still examining Richie) So they go through fever and delirium passing from your state to Matthias'? And then, At Matthias, they hold again. Indefinitely.   CLOSE SHOT - DUTCH  DUTCH I've seen them go over before. I almost got killed last summer by a friend. He went over without any warning. When I looked away. he was kind of pale and: his hair was going. When I looked back he didn't have any eyes.  MED. SHOT - GROUP   NEVILLE (looking up)  What did you do...? Dutch shrugs, looks At Neville steadily.  DUTCH  Why doctor, I did like you do. I killed the son of a bitch.  LISA (insistently)  Listen, if the Masonic rites are over, how about Richie?  Neville rises and they walk INTO NEXT ROOM. Other KIDS sit around reading, playing guitar, eating.  NEVILLE  We'll take him to my place. I've got most of what I need there.  LISA (scornfully) Is there anything you can do, Doctor? Youve lost  200 million patients already.  Neville studies her a moment.   NEVILLE I don't have it.   LISA Have what? Time, a care?  NEVILLE  I don't have the plague. I'm immune.  REACTION SHOT - GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS Even Lisa looks awed. Dutch frowns, confused.  DUTCH Everybody...has it NEVILLE (quietly) Everybody but me. There was a vaccine. Only an experimental batch. We never thought...  PAN SHOT - YOUNGSTERS  They watch Neville expressionless DUTCH If' you're immune, then your...

Neville picks up a hypo, draws some fluid from a small phial, gives Richie a shot. After a moment or so, his restlessness abates. Lisa comes into room quietly, comes up behind Neville quite close. She is in shadow, only barely visible.  LISA How about a break?   NEVILLE  Well need one. There's nothing more to do until tomorrow...   LISA  I mean for dinner.  Neville turns.  MED.

They hated our skin, our eyes, They resented us because we could still walk in the sunlight, enjoy the breeze and the flowers and the clouds rolling in from the oceans.

CLOSE - NEVILLE  Examining Richie. Finishes examination begins drawing blood with large syringe.   NEVILLE But the last irony is Matthias. Look who gets left behind to play Noah after the flood.

You remember that place where there was light? The place where the creeps all came at night trying to bring it down?   RICHIE  Yeah, sure...  LISA  This is it. This is Neville. He's ...the landlord, I guess. (slyly)  Richie eases back, somewhat reassured.  RICHIE How sick is he?  Lisa smiles sardonically at Neville.  LISA He isnt hardly sick at all, honey. Maybe just a little spooked once in a while.  He's going to get you well.  RICHIE Well, hell. You know there aint no way...  NEVILLE I'm going to try. What have you got-to loose?

Lisa looks puzzled.   LISA What?    NEVILLE Hell be the source of more antibodies. The more people we can inject, the more we'll have serum for...the others. And when thats done, we'll pull out. We'll take what we need, and head for the mountains and the valleys ... think of what's out there...    MED. SHOT - LISA  She is listening, but her expression shows that she is preoccupied with other thoughts. Neville has left workbench and walks across apartment. Lisa walks with him.

NEVILLE Almost what?   LISA Almost glad that it ... happened.  CAMERA PULLS OUT TO TWO SHOT  Neville pours a drink, mixes one for Lisa. He looks up coldly, almost angrily.    NEVILLE I'm not glad, but Im not moaning, either. I told them in Biowar, you people are crazy. This kind of research...  (breaks off) ...Ah, why do you think I was a colonel instead of a lieutenant general?   LISA  Now they know.   NEVILLE No, they dont know a goddamned thing. They're dead. We know.  (beat)  Forget it.

We SEE a small FIGURE on a bicycle pedaling across the far side of the open space. It is the child we met in the house with Al and Richie and the Others. She conceals her bicycle at the edge of the plaza and scurries fearfully across the open space to the fountain. On the edge of its lowest basin, she lays out a pitiful array of flowers and an apple or two from a paper shopping bag she carries. She crouches, kneeling with her hands clasped, hardly daring to look up at Neville's tower.  GIRL Please...I brought you this stuff. Don't let them take me either, and put me in a bag. Please.  She HEARS the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring closer and races terror-struck, for her bicycle. As she DISAPPEARS, Neville's car crosses the plaza at speed, slowing only enough for the garage doors to open and ENTER. The girl's offering lies unheeded on the fountain.  VERY CLOSE HAND WITH HYPODERMIC NEEDLE CAMERA PULLS OUT TO MED. CLOSE - NEVILLE is injecting Richie with serum. The boy is unconscious, mumbling deliribusly.    RICHIE  ...got to move fast, keep on moving. That Matthias,  he wants you. All the cops want' I you. They gonna  get you, boy, they gonna make you come over, you hear?

LISA What do you mean "things Arent they human, too?  NEVILLE Yeah ... I guess you could call them that. How many are there? Forty? ... Fifty? The last of those four billion steamy bodies that were crawling around last time somebody took a count. They were a dandy bunch weren't they?  LISA They did the best they could. Who the hell are you to put down the human race?   NEVILLE Me? I'm nobody, baby ... but at least I know it. I was just part of the crowd, and I didn't think much of it.   LISA  Well I do! They made the world...that's what it was all about.  NEVILLE No, honey...they RUINED it ... we're living in what they made of it, and God help us. Pretty soon those sick animals out there'll be gone, and then we will be too and all that'll be left is this (points to his collection of cultural artifacts) That one Rembrandt's worth more than everyone left alive in this stinking city! Maybe in a hundred years or so Godll get around to kicking through the ashes down here and read Shakespeare and say, "Well ... maybe it was worth it."  LISA I've heard that kind of talk before, you uppity, honky pig...and I HATE IT!  NEVILLE Ohhh, lovely! Yeah ... I've heard THAT kind of talk before, too, and that got everybody a hell of a long way, didn't it? There're just about enough of us here to go through all that again, right? (more)  NEVILLE (CONTID) You can found a Panther cell, and I can start up a White Citizens Council! Or shall I be the SDS and you can be the whole damn Harvard faculty?! Too bad we don't have enough folks around to do the United Nations over, isn't it!  CLOSE - LISA  She is boiling, but holds her control. She speaks quietly, matter-of-factly.  LISA Neville, you are a bastard. A class-A bastard.   MED. SHOT - LISA WALKING TOWARD DOOR   NEVILLE (O.S.) Where are you headed?  Lisa stops, turns.  LISA I know it doesn't mean much to you, but it happens this is an anniversary. Two years ago today, all those no-good people you just wrote off, died in this town. I've got a mother and father Richie and I buried with our own hands out there, after the Army stopped burning the bodies. Id like to go visit them, if it's all right with you!

On it are the names and dates of her parents:  Richard and Lorena McNally Born, Montgomery, Alabama Died, Los Angeles, California 1977  In front of the marker are a couple of tin coffee cans with the remains of long-wilted flowers in them.   VERY CLOSE LISAS FACE  She stands for a moment, silent, near tears. Then she speaks in a low, almost conversational tone.   LISA Listen, I know I don't come like I should. But it's hard times, momma, daddy. You never knew what hard times was. You only thought you did.  Suddenly, above her monologue, she HEARS a SOUND. A SOB. It .is not the sound of an animal, but a human sound, She whirls, a copy of Neville, the sten gun she is carrying ready to fire. She cocks it as she turns, and her face is hard. She sees nothing.   MED. LONG SHOT - CRYPT LISAS POV  Perhaps some thirty meters away through the weeds and grass, she sees a crypt. It, too, is overgrown with moss, ivy, and has not been cared for.   CLOSE - LISA  She slowly approaches crypt, gun ready, a little on edge, curious.   VOICE (O.S.)  Oh, God ... oh...  Lisa stops as she HEARS this MOAN, then moves cautiously around to front of crypt.

She wears sunglasses and a scarf though it is not bright. Her hair has a few subtle streaks in it and her skin has lightened also. Neville has glanced at the car as it arrived, is now turned back to fountain.   NEVILLE It's an illusion, you know.

He did send you, One way or  the other, you came back to offer us  something from his world, to change  us back, cripple us, destroy our  dedication to what must be done.   RICHIE (0.S.)  I was almost like you, but he saved  me ... brought me back. He wants as all  to go away from here...    MATTHIAS He damned you. Don't you see?

He hears a sound, a scuttling, as If someone were tip toeing from one place to another.  Neville palls a concussion grenade out of his satchel, pulls the pin with his teeth, holds it in his left hand. He turns, tosses the grenade into the room and covers his ears. The EXPLOSION is deafening, sounding down the corridors.  SEQUENCE OF FLASH CUTS:  This is very brief - DARKENED HALLWAYS AND CORRIDORS as the booming SOUND of the EXPLOSION moves along them.  MED.

The creature lies on the pavement, bleeding, twitching. CAMERA HOLDS as Neville begins running again, this time directly TOWARD CAMERA, running over the body of the thing he has killed.

NEVILLE  Lisa ... Lisa...  Lisas voice is strange and distant, and odd quality in It as if it were being heard through water.   LISA (O.S.)  Yes...Robert...  Neville relaxes, puts down his gun. He walks a step or two toward the SOUND of her VOICE - by the draperies, now pulled to cover the balcony windows.    NEVILLE  Richie ... went to Matthias ... he's...   MED.

As CAMERA CLOSES, she turns so that her face is now illuminated by the -candle. When SHOT completes, Lisa stands revealed. Her hair is white, face deadly pale, eyes completely blank.

At the end of the sequence, se SEE some of the FAMILY setting FIRE to the draperies, the books, the kindling left of furniture. One of the creatures begins to SMASH the lense of the balcony floodlights. During this sequence, Matthias VOICE COMES OVER   MATTHIAS (O.S.)  We waited for you, Neville. So you could see this the end of everything youve done. You see? None of it was real. It was a dream. Your art, your scienceit was all a nightmare. And now its doneits finished.

They slow down in middle of the Plaza, near the fountain, awaiting truck.   MATTHIAS (O.S.)  Lisa.  His voice is soft, almost caressing. It is the same voice in which he addressed Richie before stabbing him.  MED. CLOSE SHOT - LISA AND NEVILLE  They look back and up--toward balcony of Neville's apartment.
