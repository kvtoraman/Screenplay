GEORGE	 Miss Earhart?	AMELIA	 Mr. Putnam? GEORGE (softly) I asked you to sit.	AMELIA	 Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog.	GEORGE		Amelia
AMELIA (CONT'D)	 You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well...	OCTOPUS CLUB	 (on cue)	REALLY STRANGE!		AMELIA	 They are, actually. She pats the grass beside her.   Sam has no choice but to sit.	Amelia
AMELIA (CONT'D)	 Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything.	GEORGE	 (a smile) Simpkin.	AMELIA	 It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching.			Amelia
GEORGE	 Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam. The women trade smiles.   They shake hands, holding eye contact.	DOROTHY	 Great to meet you. George talks so much about you. (a wink) In fact, lately, you're all he does talk about.	PHOTOGRAPHER	 Hold those smiles for one more, please.			Amelia
BILL	 You're serious.	AMELIA	 Just as serious as you're hung over. (to Slim) You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane.	AMELIA (CONT'D)				Amelia
AMELIA	 I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise...	REPORTER	 (calls out) But you can fly, can't you? Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas.	AMELIA	 This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record.	REPORTER	 So you could have done it yourself!	Amelia
DOROTHY	 Hey, that's my job. (to Amelia) Do you think there's enough of him to boss for the two of us?	AMELIA	 Barely enough for one.	REPORTER	 Miss Earhart, can you tell us some- thing about your future plans?			Amelia
GEORGE (CONT'D)	 This week's marriage proposals. The top one's the most creative. It's from Sing Sing. She starts to read.    Her eyes widen.   Goodness. AMELIA (reads) `...in the prison yard, so everyone can watch and share in our...' ( looks up) Did you write the copy on this one, too? DOROTHY (O.S., approaching) Have you no shame, George? No sense of the scandal you create? They look up.   She has a tray of lemonade and cookies.	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	 You make her work for nothing. At least you can feed her. (to Amelia) Are you done yet? If not, make him write the rest, he will anyway.					Amelia
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)	 Really, it was about the chance to be around her. cards, frowning as he goes. MELIA (George imitation) This will never do, A.E., simply unacceptable. AMELIA (George imitation) You need more ammunition in these cards, and where's the goddamned humor, for Chrissake? By which I mean something actually funny! AMELIA (George imitation) And please remember not to turn your pretty little backside to the crowd when you use your pointer, it's your face they're paying to see. Well, most of them. AMELIA (George imitation) And another thing. Your hats. Are a menace. GEORGE (softly) Everything about you. Is a menace.	AMELIA (V.O.)	 I remember the first kiss. It is only one step.     Her hand goes to his chest.    Her eyes close, as... She brings her mouth to his.     Tender and strong.    And deep. It is an act of decision. A held look. No one smiles. We hear her name ANNOUNCED from the podium. But she keeps looking at him. And as the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she finally... ...turns. STRIDES onto the stage, with one graceful wave, she brings the applause to a crescendo.	AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)	 Of course, I knew all the stories T hat Dorothy had been having a torrid affair with Fred Upton. Everyone did. She steps to the microphone.     The crowd quiets.			Amelia
ELINOR (CONT'D)	 What I mean is. It's a good thing. That's why I want it. Now our couple is trying not to laugh.	GEORGE	 Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? ELINOR (straight back) To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot. The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically dumbstruck.	AMELIA	 Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip?	ELINOR	 I do.	Amelia
GEORGE	 If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me. He seems so sunny and strong.     What can he be feeling?	AMELIA	 I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you. GEORGE (a murmur) Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse. S he comes close enough to kiss.	AMELIA	 I know me.     And you don't.   Not really.			Amelia
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)	 Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely competitors say hello to the press announcing the First Women's Air Derby, racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers `the Powder Puff Derby,' these gals certainly know how to capture our attention. The next ANGLE shows Amelia watching some of her colleagues bouncing playfully on a see-saw. She smiles tolerantly, but maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste. INT. RECEPTION AREA, PUTNAM'S - DAY EORGE (into phone) Because Amelia invented the Powder Puff Derby for female pilots. Then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the Rockies so they won't crash into the mountains! GEORGE (into phone) I'll tell you why it's a front page story. Because Amelia pulled every woman out of the race. So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. You want me to write your headline? GEORGE (into phone) Call you back. I've got a very important guest.	ELINOR	 Wish I was important enough for you to manage.					Amelia
GEORGE	 he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true.	AMELIA	 And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE (calm, straight) Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this.	AMELIA	 What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work?	GEORGE	 I didn't say that.	Amelia
GEORGE (CONT'D)	 So the Simpkin thing. What was all that?	AMELIA	 I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? GEORGE (very soft) Either way, something to look forward to. AMELIA (murmurs) Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and... AMELIA (a whisper) I want to see their heads high. When I come home.	AMELIA (CONT'D)	 See ya.			Amelia
SECRETARY (O.S.)	 Mr. Putnam? Line three. He turns and looks at her. The girl's eyes go down and he BOLTS to the phone, SNATCHES the receiver, SLAMS the button... GEORGE (into phone) Putnam.	VOICE (O.S.)	 Sir, this is Douglas McGuire of the Press Association. I'm sorry to tell you that Miss Earhart's plane has crashed in a field, short of Le Bourget airport.					Amelia
AMELIA	 When I left, I was aiming for Paris. Oh. MAN (very sad) Ya missed, y'know.	(POINTS)	 It's over there.					Amelia
AMELIA	 What are you trying to say?	GEORGE	 I think I've just said it. A long held look.       Neither backing away.   Sadness on both sides. GEORGE (softly) Is there anything you want to say? She sighs.       Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with affection.	AMELIA	 I can't think of anything helpful. He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly... Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She stares after him. H e disappears into the house.       She's still staring.			Amelia
GEORGE (CONT'D)	 Even though I'd never seen it. HOLD on him.     The pain of what that must mean.    And...	AMELIA	 I suppose I thought.      It was too revealing. WIDEN ANGLE. Gene enters the room with a drink in his hand and sits down next to her, concerned by her obvious distress. AMELIA (into the phone) I'm so glad you have it now.	(LISTENS)	 S			Amelia
GENE	 I'm sorry I said it that way. This s actually about you, because I'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about.	AMELIA	 And what's your point? Women are eld to some higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? ENE (quietly) Of course they are.	AMELIA	 Well, let's change that, shall we? r would you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier.	GENE	 If you want to make money, my guess s that people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful.	Amelia
AMELIA (CONT'D)	 Because she can't help. All she can be is dependent. Because that I s what she's been trained to be. CO-ED #2 (hushed) Common room. Oh. Sure. (hand over phone, to	AMELIA)	 He says he's the man in your life.	AMELIA	 Trust me. Only a husband talks like that. AMELIA (into the phone) Yes?  Yes. Yes... (hand over phone, to the			Amelia
AMELIA)	 He says he's the man in your life.	AMELIA	 Trust me. Only a husband talks like that. AMELIA (into the phone) Yes?  Yes. Yes... (hand over phone, to the	GIRLS)	 They love when we say `yes.' (			Amelia
AMELIA(CONT'D)	 This showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted...	(SNIFFLES)	 They thought I was competent. GEORGE (softly) I meant.    Or maybe we can quit. She looks over.    Not sure if...	AMELIA	 You mean after.	GEORGE	 Or.     Even now. A strong smile.    He nods.     We could.	Amelia
AMELIA	 And then what?	GEORGE	 Then the best part.    The future. She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him. AMELIA (a whisper) Oh yeh.    That. She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep. Longing. Her body sinks into him. LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other.					Amelia
AMELIA	 Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it's all about her.	GEORGE	 And one of them.    Is right. AMELIA (a murmur) She knows.	GEORGE	 want you to give me something.	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 Tell me this is your last flight.	Amelia
AMELIA	 We can't possibly afford this.	GEORGE	 ure, we can. It's Tuesday's call o Lae that we can't afford. AMELIA (delighted) You hang up the phone this minute. You'll bankrupt us and I'll have to walk home.	GEORGE	 easoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. Her eyes remember.    A soft...	AMELIA	 ..and it's fun.	Amelia
GEORGE	 I'm running a big adventure here, 'm a very important fellow.	AMELIA	 You told me I was the star.   And you were no one at all. GEORGE (soft) I thought I was lying. Guess the joke's on me. Silence.	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 How's Fred?	AMELIA	 I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay?	Amelia
AMELIA	 t's late here. Guess I'll go curl up under a teacup.	GEORGE	 I'll go tell the world you're on your way. Neither wants to let go.      We feel it so strong. GEORGE (a whisper) Sweet dreams. A beat. AMELIA (whispers back) See ya. And he's gone.      She stares at the radio.					Amelia
BELLARTS	 That's her on 3105. She said `cloudy and overcast.' O'Hare looks at him. Are you serious? Bellarts mimes typing with his fingers. O'Hare starts typing into the log.	AMELIA (O.S.)	 Itasca from Earhart. Overcast. Static.   Dalten leans to the mic... DALTEN (into mic) We are receiving your signal. Please acknowledge ours. What is your position?
