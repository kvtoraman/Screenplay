JACK	 Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir.  You have lovely sheep.	TRUCK DRIVER	 (as he clambers back up on his truck) Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on the road.  Good luck to you.	DAVID	 Thanks again!			American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 I don't know.	JACK	 (like an announcer) Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe!  See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit!  See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican!  Never has the screen dared....	DAVID	 If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.	JACK	 I have to make love to her. It's very simple.  She has no choice really.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 Maybe the owners are from Texas.	JACK	 (to Woman) Remember the Alamo?	WOMAN	 I beg your pardon?	DAVID	 He was joking.  Thank you.	American Werewolf in London 
WOMAN	 Joking?  I remember The Alamo. I saw it once in London, in Leicester Square.	CHESS PLAYER	 She means in the cinema, that film with John Wayne. (turns to board) Checkmate.	DAVID	 Oh, yes, of course.	JACK	 Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died in it.  It was very bloody.	American Werewolf in London 
CHESS PLAYER	 You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.	WOMAN	 (heavy sarcasm) Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!	CHESS PLAYER	 All right, laugh then.  I shan't tell it.	WOMAN	 Oh, come on, tell us.	American Werewolf in London 
CHESS PLAYER	 No.  You've had your chance.	JACK	 (to David) Ask them what the candles are for.	DAVID	 (to Jack) You ask them.	JACK	 (to David) Listen, that's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.  It's used in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 (to David) Ask them what the candles are for.	DAVID	 (to Jack) You ask them.	JACK	 (to David) Listen, that's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.  It's used in witchcraft.

The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 (to Jack) I see.  You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.	JACK	 (to David) Right.	DAVID	 (to Jack) Wrong. The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.	CHESS PLAYER	 Oh, all right.  There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York.  It was full of men from the United Nations.	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 (to David) Right.	DAVID	 (to Jack) Wrong. The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.	CHESS PLAYER	 Oh, all right.  There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York.  It was full of men from the United Nations.	WOMAN	 That's very funny, that is.	American Werewolf in London 
WOMAN	 That's very funny, that is.	JACK	 (to David) Go on, ask them.	DAVID	 (to Jack) You ask them.	CHESS PLAYER	 Here now, let me finish!  So halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane.  So they heave out all the baggage, but it's still too heavy.  So they chuck out the seats, but it's still too heavy!  Finally this Froggy steps up and shouts "Viva la France" and leaps out.  Then an Englishman....	American Werewolf in London

DART PLAYERS	 Hear!  Hear!	CHESS PLAYER	 (undaunted) ...steps up and shouts `God save the Queen!' and leaps out.  But the plane is still too heavy.  So the Yank delegate from Texas steps up, shouts, `Remember the Alamo!' and chucks out the Mexican.	DART PLAYER	 Remember the Alamo!	JACK	 Excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for?	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 Excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for?	DART PLAYER	 (angry) You've made me miss.	JACK	 I'm sorry.	DART PLAYER	 I've never missed the board before.	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 Apparently so.	WOMAN	 (to men) You can't let them go.	DAVID	 (worried) How much do we owe you?	CHESS PLAYER	 Nothing, lads.  Go, God be with you.	American Werewolf in London 
WOMAN	 (to men) You can't let them go.	DAVID	 (worried) How much do we owe you?	CHESS PLAYER	 Nothing, lads.  Go, God be with you.	DAVID	 Uh, thank you.	American Werewolf in London

DAVID	 What's the plan?	JACK	 (nervously) Plan?	DAVID	 (not too relaxed himself) Let's just keep walking.	DAVID	 That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors.  Tra-la-la, isn't this fun?	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 (nervously) Plan?	DAVID	 (not too relaxed himself) Let's just keep walking.	DAVID	 That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors.  Tra-la-la, isn't this fun?	DAVID	 It's in front of us.	American Werewolf in London 
MISS GALLAGHER	 I looked.	ALEX	 (smiles) Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.	DR. HIRSCH	 Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss Price is quite right.	ALEX	 Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 The guy I was with.  Is he all right?  How did I get to London?	DR. HIRSCH	 (quietly) Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead. David jolts up in bed and shouts.	DAVID	 What?	DAVID	 Ow, shit!	American Werewolf in London 
MR. COLLINS	 Mr. Goodman's body has been air-freighted back to New York for burial and your parents have wired funds for your stay in the hospital until you are well enough to fly home.

COLLINS	 (distraught, clutching his briefcase) I realize how upsetting this must be for you, Mr. Kessler, but please try to refrain from hysterics.	DR. HIRSCH	 Prepare a hypodermic, please, Miss Price.	MR. COLLINS	 Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to excite yourself.  Everything has been arranged.  I shall come back to check on your progress and send a report to your parents.  The police have requested to interview you and I have given them permission to do so.	American Werewolf in London 
DR. HIRSCH	 You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while.  You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow.  They say a mad man has the strength of ten.	DAVID	 (softly, as the drugs take hold) Lunatic?	DR. HIRSCH	 Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now.  Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.	DAVID	 (softly) It wasn't a lunatic.	American Werewolf in London 
DR. HIRSCH	 Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now.  Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.	DAVID	 (softly) It wasn't a lunatic.	ALEX	 (puzzled) I beg your pardon?	DAVID	 It was a wolf.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 (softly) It wasn't a lunatic.	ALEX	 (puzzled) I beg your pardon?	DAVID	 It was a wolf.	ALEX	 (bends down close to hear) What?	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 It was a wolf.	ALEX	 (bends down close to hear) What?	DAVID	 A wolf.	DR. HIRSCH	 Did he say a wolf?	American Werewolf in London 
MISS GALLAGHER	 Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.	DAVID	 (awakened) I was having a nightmare.	MISS GALLAGHER	 Yes, well these should help that.  That's right, drink up.	MISS GALLAGHER	 Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.	American Werewolf in London 
MISS GALLAGHER	 An American film about the Mafia called `See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.	DAVID	 (dropping off) Do you have bad dreams, too?	MISS GALLAGHER	 Some, everyone does.	DAVID	 Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?	American Werewolf in London 
ALEX	 You know, did he seem depressed?  Do you think he'll eat the food?	ORDERLY	 (annoyed) I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist!  I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.	ALEX	 Thank you.			American Werewolf in London 
ALEX	 (softly) Mr. Kessler?	DAVID	 (lifeless) Yes?	ALEX	 You haven't eaten your lunch.	DAVID	 I'm not very hungry, thank you.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 How is that?	ALEX	 (she shakes the paper cup) Well, you're to take these after you've eaten.  Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?	DAVID	 Leave the pills.  I'll take them later.	ALEX	 Sorry.	American Werewolf in London 
DR. HIRSCH	 You've never had bad dreams before?	DAVID	 (upset) Sure, as a kid.  But never so real.  Never so bizarre.	DR. HIRSCH	 Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?	DAVID	 I've told you, it wasn't a man.  It was an animal.  A big wolf or something.  A rabid dog.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 I've told you, it wasn't a man.  It was an animal.  A big wolf or something.  A rabid dog.	DR. HIRSCH	 (chewing on his glasses) Yes.	DAVID	 Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart.  I saw him.  A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.	DR. HIRSCH	 You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.	American Werewolf in London 
DAVID	 Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me?  You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.	DR. HIRSCH	 (rubs his forehead) David, please.  The police are satisfied.  I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.	DAVID	 You really think I'm crazy, don't you?	DR. HIRSCH	 Believe me.  The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.	American Werewolf in London 
DR. HIRSCH	 Now really, David.  You're far too intelligent to go on this way.  When you return to America I want you to seek out a competent psychiatrist or psychologist or something and stop this nonsense.  You'll be leaving this hospital in three or four days, please remain sane.  At least until you are no longer our responsibility.	DAVID	 Dr. Hirsch? (pause) I'd rather not be by myself.	DR. HIRSCH	 Of course not, David.  I'll fetch in young Miss Price.	DISSOLVE		American Werewolf in London

DR. HIRSCH	 David has suffered a severe trauma.  I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor.  If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?	ALEX	 (bewildered) Dr. Hirsch?	DR.

ALEX	 He's here.	DR. HIRSCH	 (excited) Is he all right?  Why didn't you call me?  Where was he?	ALEX	 He doesn't remember.  He woke up at the zoo.	DR. HIRSCH	 The zoo?  Is he rational?	American Werewolf in London 
ALEX	 The next corner we can get a cab.	DAVID	 (grins) I should be committed.	ALEX	 Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.	DAVID	 (stretches) I don't know why I feel so good.  I haven't felt this good in a long time.	American Werewolf in London

JACK	 Thank you.	DAVID	 (apologizes quickly) I didn't mean it.  I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people.  I don't remember doing it.	JACK	 What about the zoo?	DAVID	 Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that.  I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway.  We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.	BRINGSLY	 (in shadow; very English) Yes, I do look most unpleasant.	DAVID	 (horrified) Why are you doing this to me, Jack?	BRINGSLY	 This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.

And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.	BRINGSLY	 You must die, David Kessler.	American Werewolf in London 
DERELICT #2	 Can't say we're pleased to meet you, Mr. Kessler.	DAVID	 (defeated) What shall I do?	JACK	 Suicide.	HARRY	 (adamantly) You must take your own life!	American Werewolf in London 
JACK	 Suicide.	HARRY	 (adamantly) You must take your own life!	DAVID	 That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.	BRINGSLY	 No, David.  Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead.  The undead.	American Werewolf in London 
BRINGSLY	 No, David.  Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead.  The undead.	DAVID	 (to Jack) Why are you doing this to me?	JACK	 Because this must be stopped.	DAVID	 How shall I do it?	American Werewolf in London
