ANYA	 There's no choice...	VLADIMIR	 (to Tatiana) Your "guest" is unable to attend.	ANYA	 Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!	VLADIMIR	 (formally) Yes, your highness.	Anastasia 
ANYA	 Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!	VLADIMIR	 (formally) Yes, your highness.	ANYA	 Poor Meetoo!	VLADIMIR	 (formally) Yes, your highness.	Anastasia 
ANYA	 Poor Meetoo!	VLADIMIR	 (formally) Yes, your highness.	ANYA	 Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.	TATIANA	 But they didn't take the money - either one of them. I offered it to them, but they both refused.	Anastasia 
TATIANA	 No, he just wanted to know you were happy.	VLADIMIR	 (taking Sophie's hand) Fortunately, I am to be married. (backing away) With your highness, permission.	ANYA	 Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!	VLADIMIR	 No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?	Anastasia

RASPUTIN (CONT.)	 Do not despair. I'll make sure your beloved princess drops in.	BARTOK	 (depressed) Ahh, very witty. There's this English guy - Noel Coward - I'll bet he's quaking ...					Anastasia 
ANYA	 Dmitri, what's wrong?	RASPUTIN	 (from above) Throw her off the edge! Do it!	ANYA	 Dmitri ... Look at me! It's Anya! It's ANYA!	ANYA	 You saved my life in the palace! You won't take it now...	Anastasia 
ANYA	 You saved my life in the palace! You won't take it now...	RASPUTIN	 (from above)	FINISH HER!		ANYA	 Dmitri. I know you would never hurt me. You love me.	Anastasia 
RASPUTIN	 My curse is now complete! Good-bye, babushka!	DMITRI	 Take my hand! (sees Rasputin approaching) Hurry!	ANYA	 Don't let me go!	DMITRI	 I'll never let go!	Anastasia 
ANYA	 I am home.	"HONE IS WHERE YOU ARE"	 (The Love Duet For Anya And Dmitri). A SIMPLE EMOTIONAL BALLAD for two people who realize at last that their hearts have led then to each other, to "home". This will work within the dramatic context of the film (sung by the characters) but can also be re-recorded as a Pop single.					Anastasia
