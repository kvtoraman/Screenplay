ALADDIN. )	 (ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.) (ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.) (ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.) (They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling they're being followed.) (He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.) (Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.) (The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.) (The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.) (The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.") (They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar, with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.) (ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)	NO!	 (ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake.) (ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.) (Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.) (CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.) (ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.) (ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.) (He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off his disguise.) (Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.) (Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.) (CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.) (ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.) (He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.) (He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.) (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck drops with the secret word "Refunds.' ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming. GENIE:  (Music for "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a fluorescent light) (GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.) (Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs lamp with it.) (GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. ) (GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.) (The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.) (ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out.) (The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.) (The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.) (GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) (The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.) (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got it! ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here-- (They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them.) (The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.) (Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is coming in for a landing.) (GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a sheep.) (GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.) (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Itty bitty living space ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible. GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and smell the hummus ALADDIN:    Why not? GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's happened. ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free. GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh huh, right.  Whoop! ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.   (He holds out his hand) GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.) O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want most? ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl-- GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and... GENIE:  Pretty? ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and this hair, wow...and her smile. GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.) Ami.  C'est l'amour. ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince? GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh, chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab? (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the words! ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince! GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No! Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.) ABU:        Uh oh! GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out, it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out! (ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.) (We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.) (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.) JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to...hmm...interesting. SULTAN: What?  Who? JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me! SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure. JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.) SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures... JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me. SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell breaks momentarily)...but you're so old! JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry me! SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha. Jafar., you must come and see this! (We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.) (The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.) (ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.) (IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) (The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.) (In pops a typical parade commentator) (In comes another commentator.) (GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)	GENIE:	 GIRLS: (in couterpoint) Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses! (JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She humphs it off, then leaves.) (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!) And to view them, he charges no fee! (He's generous, so generous) He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! (Proud to work for him) They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.) (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.) (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might... ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.) (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.) (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.) JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.) SULTAN: Look out, Polly! (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.) (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.) (JASMINE walks in quietly.) (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.) (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light. GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself. ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay, I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.  How do I look? GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince. (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed, sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.) (RAJAH looks up and growls.) (Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.) (CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.) (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.) ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet. JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.) ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. JASMINE:    Is it safe? ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What? ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes. (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.) (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) (CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.) (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.) (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.) (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.) (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.) (They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.) (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.) (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.) (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.) (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.) (He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.) (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.) (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.) (JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.) (A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.) (JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.) (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.) SULTAN: Obviously...lying. (ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.) (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.) (The trio advances on JAFAR.) (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.) (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.) (They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.) (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.) Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan! ALADDIN:    Sultan? SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.) (Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.) (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar? Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip! JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago. IAGO:       Why that miserable-- JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it! IAGO:       Me? (Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.) (GENIE comes out of lamp) (ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.) (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.) (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.) (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.) (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.) (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.) (Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.) (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.) (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.) (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.) (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.) (The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.) (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.) (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her! (JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.) (JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.) (JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.) (JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.) (We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.) (JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.) (IAGO stops for a second, then continues.) (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen... (She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.) (We see ALADDIN race back into town.) (JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.) (The GENIE's jaw drops.) (JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.) (He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.) (They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.) (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.) (JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.) (Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.) (ABU rushes for the lamp.) (CARPET rushes in.) (GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)	GREAT!	 (ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.) (ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.) (He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.) (JAFAR circles around the GENIE.) (GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt. JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess pour out.) (A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.) (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it! (Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.) (IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.) (ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.) (JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.) (They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.) (A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.) (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.) (They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.) (They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.) (The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse) to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.) (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.) (Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black. The end.)	Aladdin 
NO!	 (ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to shake.) (ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock is exploding.) (Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.) (CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top, within reach.) (ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.) (ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.) (He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off his disguise.) (Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.) (Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.) (CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.) (ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.) (He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.) (He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.) (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck drops with the secret word "Refunds.' ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming. GENIE:  (Music for "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here! So why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a fluorescent light) (GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.) (Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's hand and rubs lamp with it.) (GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. ) (GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.) (The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.) (ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out.) (The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.) (The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.) (GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) (The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.) (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got it! ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all powerful genie--can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here-- (They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of them.) (The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.) (Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is coming in for a landing.) (GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a sheep.) (GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.) (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Itty bitty living space ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible. GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and smell the hummus ALADDIN:    Why not? GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's happened. ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free. GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh huh, right.  Whoop! ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.   (He holds out his hand) GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.) O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want most? ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl-- GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and... GENIE:  Pretty? ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and this hair, wow...and her smile. GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.) Ami.  C'est l'amour. ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince? GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh, chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab? (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the words! ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince! GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No! Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.) ABU:        Uh oh! GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out, it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out! (ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.) (We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.) (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.) JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to...hmm...interesting. SULTAN: What?  Who? JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me! SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure. JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.) SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures... JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me. SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell breaks momentarily)...but you're so old! JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry me! SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha. Jafar., you must come and see this! (We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.) (The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.) (ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.) (IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.) (The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.) (In pops a typical parade commentator) (In comes another commentator.) (GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony, where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)	GENIE:	 GIRLS: (in couterpoint) Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses! (JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She humphs it off, then leaves.) (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!) And to view them, he charges no fee! (He's generous, so generous) He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! (Proud to work for him) They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.) (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.) (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might... ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.) (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.) (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.) JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.) SULTAN: Look out, Polly! (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.) (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.) (JASMINE walks in quietly.) (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.) (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light. GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself. ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay, I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.  How do I look? GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince. (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed, sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.) (RAJAH looks up and growls.) (Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.) (CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.) (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.) ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet. JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.) ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. JASMINE:    Is it safe? ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What? ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes. (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.) (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) (CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.) (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.) (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.) (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.) (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.) (They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.) (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.) (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.) (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.) (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.) (He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.) (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.) (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.) (JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.) (A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.) (JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.) (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.) SULTAN: Obviously...lying. (ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.) (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.) (The trio advances on JAFAR.) (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.) (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.) (They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.) (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.) Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan! ALADDIN:    Sultan? SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.) (Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.) (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar? Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip! JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago. IAGO:       Why that miserable-- JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it! IAGO:       Me? (Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.) (GENIE comes out of lamp) (ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.) (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.) (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.) (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.) (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.) (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.) (Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.) (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.) (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.) (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.) (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.) (The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.) (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.) (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her! (JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.) (JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.) (JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.) (JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.) (We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.) (JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.) (IAGO stops for a second, then continues.) (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen... (She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.) (We see ALADDIN race back into town.) (JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.) (The GENIE's jaw drops.) (JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.) (He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.) (They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.) (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.) (JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.) (Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.) (ABU rushes for the lamp.) (CARPET rushes in.) (GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)	GREAT!	 (ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.) (ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.) (He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.) (JAFAR circles around the GENIE.) (GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt. JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess pour out.) (A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.) (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it! (Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.) (IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.) (ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.) (JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.) (They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.) (A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.) (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.) (They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.) (They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.) (The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse) to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.) (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.) (Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black. The end.)			Aladdin 
GENIE:	 GIRLS: (in couterpoint) Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa There's no question this Ali's alluring That physique, how can I speak Never ordinary, never boring Weak at the knee Everything about the man just plain impresses Well, get on out in that square He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder Adjust your veil and prepare He's about to pull my heart asunder To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali! And I absolutely love the way he dresses! (JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She humphs it off, then leaves.) (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!) And to view them, he charges no fee! (He's generous, so generous) He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! (Proud to work for him) They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! (ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.) (More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.) (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might... ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. (He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.) (He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.) (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.) JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.) SULTAN: Look out, Polly! (They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.) (The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker, have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.) (JASMINE walks in quietly.) (Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.) (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light. GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself. ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay, I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.  How do I look? GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince. (ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed, sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.) (RAJAH looks up and growls.) (Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.) (CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.) (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.) ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet. JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.) ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. JASMINE:    Is it safe? ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What? ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes. (She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.) (CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) (CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.) (JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.) (They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.) (They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.) (They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.) (They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.) (They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.) (CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.) (She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.) (They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.) (He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.) (Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.) (A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) (Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.) (JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.) (A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.) (JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.) (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.) SULTAN: Obviously...lying. (ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.) (ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.) (The trio advances on JAFAR.) (But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.) (JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.) (They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.) (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.) Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan! ALADDIN:    Sultan? SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.) (Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.) (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar? Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip! JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago. IAGO:       Why that miserable-- JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it! IAGO:       Me? (Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.) (GENIE comes out of lamp) (ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.) (We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.) (We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs, then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is panting.) (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah, Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.) (Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making an announcement to the people.) (Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.) (Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.) (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.) (Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.) (His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.) (They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.) (The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.) (GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot, and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR, returning him to his normal look.) (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him. He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty- cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her! (JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.) (JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.) (JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.) (JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop. ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.) (We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.) (JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.) (IAGO stops for a second, then continues.) (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen... (She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.) (We see ALADDIN race back into town.) (JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.) (The GENIE's jaw drops.) (JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.) (He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.) (They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.) (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.) (JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.) (Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.) (ABU rushes for the lamp.) (CARPET rushes in.) (GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)	GREAT!	 (ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.) (ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.) (He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.) (JAFAR circles around the GENIE.) (GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt. JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess pour out.) (A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.) (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it! (Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.) (IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.) (ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.) (JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.) (They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.) (A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.) (He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.) (They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.) (They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.) (The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse) to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.) (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.) (Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black. The end.)					Aladdin
