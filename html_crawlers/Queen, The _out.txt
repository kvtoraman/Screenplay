ELIZABETH	 No.	ARTIST	 Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. (a beat) But it IS your Government.	ELIZABETH	 Yes.	ELIZABETH	 I suppose that is some consolation.	Queen, The

ELIZABETH	 I don't measure the depth of a curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my sister.	JANVRIN	 And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name terms. (a beat) At the Prime Minister's insistence.	ELIZABETH	 What? As in `Call me Tony?'	JANVRIN	 Yes.	Queen, The 
JANVRIN	 Yes.	ELIZABETH	 Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. (a beat) Have we sent him a protocol sheet?					Queen, The 
ELIZABETH	 So..Have we shown you how to start a nuclear war yet?	TONY	 (thrown) No.	ELIZABETH	 First thing we do, I believe. a beat) Then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world.	TONY	 You obviously know my job better than I do.	Queen, The 
TONY	 I can imagine.	ELIZABETH	 ith time, one has hopefully added experience to that education, and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional responsibility. (a pointed addition) To advise, guide and warn the government of the day.	TONY	 Advice which I look forward to receiving.	ELIZABETH	 ell, we will save that for our weekly meetings. a beat) Now, if there's nothing else, I believe we have some business to attend to..	Queen, The 
TONY	 Your Majesty, the country has spoken...and I come now to ask your permiss..   E	ELIZABETH	 (interjecting) No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask the questions.	ELIZABETH	 Mr Blair, the people have elected you to be their leader. And so the duty falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask you to become Prime Minister, and form a government in my name.	ELIZABETH	 Generally, this is where you say `yes.'	Queen, The 
CHERIE	 (mimics QUEEN's manner) "Thank you so much for coming. Now bugger off."	TONY	 I know. What was all that about?	CHERIE	 Diana. Apparently she's got a new boyfriend.			Queen, The 
RENCH REPORTER	 (in French) ..the Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed returned to Paris earlier today..	ERMAN REPORTER	 ..where they visited a local jewellery shop where unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Fayed had been looking at engagement rings..					Queen, The

QUEEN MOTHER	 That's the latest?	PRINCE PHILIP	 I don't know. I can't hear.. (indicates TELEVISION) Everyone's shouting!					Queen, The 
CHARLES	 Perhaps now you might consider whether it's still an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future King of England in one of our planes?	ELIZABETH	 (after a long pause) All right.	ELIZABETH	 (to FOOTMAN) I don't want the boys to see the news and get upset. First thing tomorrow morning, I want the radio taken out of their bedroom, and the television taken out of the nursery.			Queen, The 
JANVRIN	 I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am, but I've the Prime Minister, for you. From his constituency.	QUEEN MOTHER	 (privately rolls eyes, without looking up from newspaper) Lucky you.	ELIZABETH	 Thank you, Robin. I'll take it next door. T he QUEEN gets to her feet and walks out into..			Queen, The 
TONY	 I don't suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet?	ELIZABETH	 We've spoken to the Spencer family, and it's their wish.. (a beat) ..their express wish, that it should be a private funeral. With a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.	TONY	 Right.	ELIZABETH	 Given that Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family we have no choice but to respect their wishes.	Queen, The 
TONY	 You don't feel that in view of her high profile and popularity.. ( choosing his words carefully) ...it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life and achievements? (a beat) Or even just to her as a mother?	ELIZABETH	 As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.	TONY (CONT'D)	 And the public, Ma'am? The British People?			Queen, The 
TONY	 To share in the grief?	ELIZABETH	 It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not a fairground attraction. (a beat) I think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press, don't you?	ELIZABETH (CONT'D)	 Now, if there is nothing else I must get on. The children have to be looked after.	TONY	 Of course.	Queen, The 
TONY	 I... (a diplomatic smile) I think that would present us with difficulties. C	HARLES	 So do I. My mother.. (corrects himself) ...the Queen, comes from a generation not best equipped to... (tailing off) ...she grew up in the war... (a beat) I think what we need, what the COUNTRY needs is to be led by someone.."of today". If you follow? (a beat) Balmoral is.. (he gestures, `another world')					Queen, The 
TONY	 "I want to set an ambitious course to modernise this country. To breathe new life into our institutions. To make privilege something for the many, not the few. So that we become nothing less than a beacon to the world..." A	LASTAIR	 Bloody hell! You think the Royals are nutters! You should meet their flunkeys! Two and a half-hours on whether she should be carried in a hearse or a gun-carriage. (taps head, "Nuts") Anyway, raves in the press.

QUEEN MOTHER	 B-but that's the code name for my funeral?    J	ANVRIN	 ndeed, Ma'am. (a beat) But it would be for practical reasons only.	ANVRIN	 It's the only one which has been.. (treads delicately) ..`rehearsed'. The only one that could be put together..in time.	QUEEN MOTHER	 But I supervised those plans myself.	Queen, The 
ELIZABETH	 I see..	JANVRIN	 And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other.. (clears throat) ...celebrities..	QUEEN MOTHER	 Celebrities..?	ELIZABETH	 Oh.	Queen, The 
JANVRIN	 Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police Commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book. (a beat) It would give the growing crowds something to do. Make marshalling them easier.	ELIZABETH	 (distracted) Yes, of course..	JANVRIN	 Oh, and the flowers.	ELIZABETH	 W hat flowers?	Queen, The 
TONY	 Not at all.	AMPORT	 He feels you and he...are modern men...of similar mind... (a beat) ...who could work well together at this difficult time.

Queen, The 
ELIZABETH	 Not `us', dear.	CHARLES	 (not having heard) What?	CHARLES	 Yesterday, when we drove the coffin back into London, there was a noise. A bang. I don't mind telling you I thought it was a gun.	CHARLES (CONT'D)	 I thought someone had taken a shot at me. E	Queen, The 
CHARLES	 Are you sure?	ELIZABETH	 Yes. It looks like rain.. (the DOGS jump out) And I'm not in the mood for stalking anyway.	ELIZABETH	 Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You don't want me to trip and hurt myself, do you? a beat) You wouldn't get any proper walks then.	ELIZABETH	 Right. Done. Now who knows the way home?	Queen, The 
IANA (ON TV)	 ..I think..they see me as a threat of some kind..	PRINCE PHILIP	 (puckers face) Oh, for God's sake..	ELIZABETH	 Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are partly to blame.	PRINCE PHILIP	 I can't watch this.	Queen, The 
DIANA (ON TV)	 "And I think it's this strength that causes the confusion and the fear."	PRINCE PHILIP	 And I was sure he'd give the other one up. Or, at least make sure his wife towed the line. (a gesture) Isn't that what everyone does?	ELIZABETH	 Is it?	DIANA (ON TV)	 "Why is she strong? Where is she getting it from? Where is she going to take it? How is she going to use it?"	Queen, The 
DIANA (ON TV)	 "Why is she strong? Where is she getting it from? Where is she going to take it? How is she going to use it?"	PRINCE PHILIP (CONT'D)	 I can't bear it any more.

CHERIE	 A bunch of freeloading, emotionally retarded...nutters.	TONY	 (rolls eyes) That's just absurd.	CHERIE	 Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth. They don't pay tax.	TONY	 Yes, they do.	Queen, The 
TONY	 ...or about ways in which we as a Government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges, then fine.	HERIE	 (indicating plates) If you're going, take the dishes..	TONY	 But spare me the whole.."off with their heads" thing.	CHERIE	 Why?	Queen, The 
TONY	 Because it insults your intelligence.	CHERIE	 "The case for reform is simple and obvious. It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or election." (a beat) YOUR words, not mine.	TONY	 Well, maybe now I've grown up. a beat) It's unimaginable this country being a republic. Certainly in her lifetime.	CHERIE	 Why?	Queen, The 
CHERIE	 Why?	TONY	 Because...no would would wear it. (can't help laughing at the idea) No one WANTS it. (gestures) It's just...daft.	HERIE	 It's not a mother thing, is it?	CHERIE	 Think about it. If she were still alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact she was brought up in the way. Well c'mon..?	Queen, The

(angrily jabs coals with a long, sharp fork) ...only the Royal Standard, which flies for one reason only.	PRINCE PHILIP(CONT'D)	 To denote the presence of the Monarch. Since you're here, the flag pole is bare. Which is as it should be.	CHARLES	 Isn't it possible..that to some people...the Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal.	Queen, The 
ELIZABETH	 "What about the Union Jack?", was Mr. Blair's next suggestion.	UEEN MOTHER	 (rolling eyes) Oh, for heaven's sake.	PRINCE PHILIP	 The next thing he'll be suggesting you change your name to Hilda and mine to Hector? ( angry gesture) Who does he think he's talking to? You're the Sovereign. The Head of State. You don't get dictated to. a beat) You've conceded the idea of a public funeral. You've opened up the parks. That's ENOUGH.			Queen, The 
ELIZABETH	 Like those condolence books.	PRINCE PHILIP	 Quite right. (a defiant snort) When we started with one, everyone predicted they would grow and grow. But we've heard nothing more about that, see?	CHARLES	 Apparently there are now fifteen.	ELIZABETH	 What..?	Queen, The

(a beat) But they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will eventually be the one seen by the public. But it's not. The two Dianas, theirs and ours, bear no relation to one another at all.	CHARLES (CONT'D)	 They just adored her. Would have loved nothing more than for her to be Queen. a beat) Someone compassionate. With a heart. Gifts in tragically short supply around here.	CHARLES	 I've been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at Highgrove?	Queen, The 
HERIE	 Apparently, one in six people now support the idea of getting rid of the Monarchy.	TONY	 (irritated gesture) That's just the papers spoiling for a fight.

I believe the moment for statements has passed.	Queen, The 
RINCE PHILIP	 Absurd..   E	ELIZABETH	 I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement. And it is my belief that they will soon reject this `mood' which has been stirred up by the press...in favour of a period of restrained grief, and sober, private mourning. a beat) That's the way we do things in this country. Quietly. With dignity. (a beat) It's what the rest of the world has always admired us for.	TONY	 Well, if that's your decision, Ma'am, of course the government will support it.

JANVRIN	 Prime Minister, I understand how `difficult' her behaviour must seem to you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see it from her perspective.. (searches for right words) She's been brought up to believe its God's will that she is who she is.	TONY	 I think we should leave God out of it. It's just not helpful.	JANVRIN	 She won't have seen anything like this since the Abdication. a beat)			Queen, The

"Blair more popular than Churchill shock."	TONY	 Did any of them pick up on our statement of support?			Queen, The
