GOMEZ	 It's a milestone, Tish. This very evening -- our twenty-fifth seance. All those years, gnawed by guilt, undone by woe, burning with uncertainty...

FESTER	 (coming to his senses) Mother, I'm... I'm so terribly sorry... (he kneels at her side) It was just a party. It's over. It means nothing.

WEDNESDAY	 But he isn't even Uncle Fester. Gomez and Morticia turn to look at her.	GOMEZ	 (to his family) Do not fear - justic shall prevail. The courts will decide!

WEDNESDAY	 Do you want a cigar, Father?	GOMEZ	 (in a monotone) They're very bad for you.	WEDNESDAY	 (very worried) Father? Wednesday exchanges a panic-stricken look with Morticia.

Gomez lets the phone drop. Morticia, seated on the edge of the box spring, tries to comfort him. Pugsley, Wednesday and Lurch are seated nearby, very worried about Gomez, as at a death watch. Gomez is now surrounded by junk food, and a mountain of junk food wrappers, bags and styrofoam containers. Ritually, as handmaidens, Morticia brings Gomez the remote control for the TV, and Wednesday brings him a copy of TV Guide. Pugsley brings Gomez a bag of "Doritos", and Lurch brings him a canister of "Pringles". Gomez uses the remote to switch channels.   An episode of "The Cosby Show" comes on.			Addams-Family,-The

MORTICIA	 I know - Gomez, let's go for a drive. The whole family.	GOMEZ	 (not even turning) A drive? And miss "Matlock"? Granny opens the door and sticks her head in.	GRANNY	 Dinner's going to be late. She slams the door.   We hear her whistling.	GRANNY (O.S.)	 Here, boy.   Here, boy.	Addams-Family,-The
ABIGAIL	 (very stern) What?	FESTER	 (dutifully) Yes, mother. It's beautiful. THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 4/03/91                         102.	ABIGAIL	 (instantly very sweet, dabbing her eye with a fingertip) Look - I'm weeping. Abigail exits. The minute the door shuts, Fester gets out of bed. He is fully clothed. He goes to the window, and begins to climb out.			Addams-Family,-The
ABIGAIL	 I don't think so. The vault, Mrs. Addams - any thoughts?	MORTICIA	 (sweetly, to Abigail) Despite everything, I don't hate you. I pity you.

FESTER	 I'm not stalling! Stop badgering me!	ABIGAIL	 (pushing Fester aside) Tully, take over! Tighten it! THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 2/19/91                           103A.	TULLY	 I'd love to, you know that, but - I've got this stomach thing. When I torture people. It's just me.			Addams-Family,-The

ABIGAIL	 Tighter! Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES. Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes. She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully.	MORTICIA	 (to Tully, flirtatiously) You've done this before.					Addams-Family,-The
FESTER	 (to Abigail) You can't! Not with red-hot pokers!	TULLY	 (queasy) Is this gonna smell?	MORTICIA	 (graciously, with understanding) Tully Alford - charlatan. Deadbeat. Parasite. How Gomez adored you.	TULLY	 Well, not enough.	Addams-Family,-The

FESTER	 Allow me... Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's about to do.	GOMEZ	 (murmuring) Good show, old man... Fester reaches for a DIFFERENT BOOK -- "Hurricane Irene: Nightmare from Above." Seeing the title of the book, Tully suddenly panics: THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 3/18/91                          110.	TULLY	 Put that book down, Gordon! You don't know what it can do! It's not just literture!			Addams-Family,-The
TULLY	 Put that book down, Gordon! You don't know what it can do! It's not just literture!	FESTER	 (advancing on Tully) Oh, really?	TULLY	 I'm your friend, Gordon - think of the doubloons!	FESTER	 They're not yours, Tully!     Back off! ANGLE on Gomez, releasing Morticia from the torture wheel.	Addams-Family,-The
FESTER	 You're a terrible mother!   There, I said it! Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window. Then he blasts Abigail out as well. ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed", to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale force winds.	GOMEZ	 (calling out to Fester) Old man! This way! ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the floor toward the bookshelf. Thing fights the wind, which pelts him with papers and other flying debris. Gomez can no longer fight the storm, and the bookshelf slams shut. Fester desperately tries to close the book to quell the storm, but a HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ZAPS HIM. He falls to the floor, with electricity coursing through him. MOVE IN on the storm raging within the pages of the book, then - THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 2/28/91                           110B. A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton, etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the children CHANT:	CHILDREN	 Trick or... They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.			Addams-Family,-The
GRANNY	 Well, it's their loss. I even made finger sandwiches. Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear.	FESTER	 (petting Thing) Oh, calm down.	PUGSLEY (O.S.)	 Here we come! Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down onto his feet.	GOMEZ	 Pugsley, old man!	Addams-Family,-The
GOMEZ	 Pugsley, old man!	MORTICIA	 (delighted) Look at you.	PUGSLEY	 (to Uncle Fester) How do you like it? Fester is very touched; he picks Pugsley up. THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 2/15/91                         111A.			Addams-Family,-The

It lights. Pugsley giggles. Gomez stands up, having finished the pumpkin. He places it on a table, and lights the candle inside. The pumpkin glows. It has ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD. Everyone oohs and ahhs.			Addams-Family,-The
MORTICIA	 Of course - "Wake The Dead."	FESTER	 (delighted, to Gomez remembering this childhood favorite) "Wake The Dead"!	GOMEZ	 (equally excited) "Wake The Dead"! Out to the cemetery!
