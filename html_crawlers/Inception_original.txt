                                            SHOOTING SCRIPT
  FADE IN:

  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He
  COLLAPSES.

  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER

  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

                     ATTENDANT
               (in Japanese)
           He was delirious. But he asked for
           you by name. And...
               (to the Security Guard)
           Show him.

                     SECURITY GUARD
               (in Japanese)
           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.

                     SECURITY GUARD
           ...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in Japanese)
           Bring him here. And some food.

  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in English)
           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
                                                          2.

  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
  forefinger.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I've seen one before. Many, many
          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          It belonged to a man I met in a
          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          A man possessed of some radical
          notions...



                    COBB (V.O.)
          What's the most resilient parasite?

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)




                    COBB
          A bacteria? A virus?



                    COBB
          An intestinal worm?




                    ARTHUR
          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

                     COBB
          An idea.


                                                3.

                    COBB
          Resilient, highly contagious. Once
          an idea's taken hold in the brain
          it's almost impossible to
          eradicate. A person can cover it
          up, ignore it- but it stays there.

                    SAITO
          But surely-to forget...?

                    COBB
          Information, yes. But an idea?
          Fully formed, understood? That
          sticks...
              (taps forehead)
          In there, somewhere.

                    SAITO
          For someone like you to steal?

                    ARTHUR
          Yes. In the dream state, conscious
          defenses are lowered and your
          thoughts become vulnerable to
          theft. It's called extraction.

                    COBB
          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
          subconscious to defend itself from
          even the most skilled extractor.

                    SAITO
          How can you do that?

                    COBB
          Because I am the most skilled
          extractor. I know how to search
          your mind and find your secrets. I
          know the tricks, and I can teach
          them to your subconscious so that
          even when you're asleep, your guard
          is never down.



                    COBB
          But if I'm going to help you, you
          have to be completely open to me.
          I'll need to know my way around
          your thoughts better than your
          wife, your analyst, anyone.
              (gestures around)
          If this is a dream and you've got a
          safe full of secrets, I need to
          know what's in that safe. For this
          to work, you have to let me in.
                                                            4.




                    SAITO
          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
          consider your proposal.



                      ARTHUR
          He knows.





                    ARTHUR
          What's going on up there?

          Saito knows. He's playing with us.

          I can get it here. The
          information's in the safe- he
          looked right at it when I mentioned
          secrets.



                    ARTHUR
          What's she doing here, Cobb?




                    COBB
          You just get to your room. I'll
          take care of the rest.

                    ARTHUR
          See that you do. We're here to

          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
          why are you here?

          I thought you might be missing
          me...

          I am. But I can't trust you

          So what?

          postwar British painters.



                    COBB
          Would you sit down?

          I bring the gun because not even my

          How could you get the carpet
          wrong?!

                    NASH
          It wasn't my fault!

          You're the architect-

          I had it under control.

          I'd hate to see out of control-

          There's no time for this-I'm

          Inception.



                    SAITO
          Is it possible?

                    ARTHUR
          Of course not.

                    SAITO
          If you can steal an idea from
          someone's mind, why can't you plant
          one there instead?

                    ARTHUR
          Okay, here's planting an idea: I

              (Saito nods)
          What are you thinking about?

                       SAITO
          Elephants.

                    ARTHUR
          Right. But it's not your idea
          because you know I gave it to you.

                    SAITO
          You could plant it subconsciously-

                    ARTHUR
          The subject's mind can always trace
          the genesis of the idea. True
          inspiration is impossible to fake.

                    COBB
          No, it isn't.

                    SAITO
          Can you do it?

                    COBB
          I won't do it.

                    SAITO
          In exchange, I'll give you the
          information you were paid to steal.

                    COBB
          Are you giving me a choice? Because
          I can find my own way to square
          things with Cobol.

                    SAITO
          Then you do have a choice.

                    COBB

          Cobb, come on-

          How complex is the idea?

                    SAITO
          Simple enough.

                    COBB
          No idea's simple when you have to
          plant it in someone else's mind.

                    SAITO
          My main competitor is an old man in
          poor health. His son will soon
          inherit control of the corporation.
          I need him to decide to break up

          Cobb, we should walk away from
          this.

          it... how do I know you can
          deliver?

                    SAITO
          You don't. But I can. So do you
          want to take a leap of faith, or
          become an old man, filled with
          regret, waiting to die alone?

          You never did like your office.



                    MILES
          No space to think in that broom
          cupboard.



                    MILES
          Is it safe for you to be here?

                    COBB
          Extradition between France and the
          U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.

                    MILES
          I think they'd find a way to make
          it work in your case.



                    COBB
          Can you take these back for the
          kids?

                    MILES
          It'll take more than the occasional
          stuffed animal to convince those
          children they still have a father.

                    COBB
          I know. I thought you could talk to
          Marie about bringing them on
          vacation. Somewhere I could meet-

                    MILES
          Why would she listen to me?

                    COBB
          You were married for twenty years.

                    MILES
          She blames me as much as you.

                    COBB
          Doesn't she understand that my kids
          need me?
                                                26.

                    MILES
          Yes, she does. We all do. Go back
          and face the music, Dom. Explain
          what Mal did.

                    COBB
          Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never
          understand- they'd lock me up and
          throwaway the key. Or worse.

                    MILES
          You think what you're doing now is
          helping your case?

                    COBB
          Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
          This is what I have. This is what
          you taught me.

                    MILES
          I never taught you to be a thief.

                    COBB
          No, you taught me to navigate other
          people's minds. But after what
          happened with Mal there weren't a
          whole lot of legitimate ways for me
          to use that skill.



                    MILES
          Why did you come here, Dom?



                     COBB
          I found a way home. A job. For
          powerful people. If I pull it off,
          I can get back to my family. But I
          need help.



                    MILES
          My God. You're here to corrupt one
          of my brightest and best.

                    COBB
          If you have someone good enough,
          you have to let them decide for
          themselves. You know what I'm
          offering-

                       MILES
          Money?
                                                27.

                    COBB
          No, not just money: the chance to
          build cathedrals, entire cities-
          things that have never existed,
          things that couldn't exist in the
          real world...

                    MILES
          Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects
          are supposed to make those dreams
          real.

                    COBB
          That's not what you used to say.
          You told me that in the real world
          I'd be building attic conversions
          and gas stations. You said that if
          I mastered the dream-share I'd have
          a whole new way of creating and
          showing people my creations. You
          told me it would free me.



                    MILES
          And I'm sorry. I was wrong.

                    COBB
          No, you weren't. Your vision was a
          vision of pure creativity. It's
          where we took it that was wrong.

                    MILES
          And now you want me to let someone
          else follow you into fantasy.

          They won't actually come on the

          This job-this last job-is how I get

          I wouldn't be standing here if
          there were any other way. I can get
          home. But I need an architect who's

          A work placement?

          Aren't you going to tell me
          anything?

                    COBB
          Before I describe the job, I have
          to know you could do it.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

          You have two minutes to draw a maze

          They say we only use a fraction of
          the true potential of our brains...
          but they're talking about when
          we're awake. While we dream, the
          mind performs wonders.

                     ARIADNE
          Such as?

                    COBB
          How do you imagine a building? You
          consciously create each aspect,
          puzzling over it in stages... But
          sometimes, when your imagination
          flies-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm discovering it.

                    COBB
          Exactly. Genuine inspiration.



                    COBB
          In a dream your mind continuously
          does that...


                                                     31.

                    COBB
          It creates and perceives a world
          simultaneously. So well that you
          don't feel your brain doing the
          creating. That's why we can short-
          circuit the process...

                    ARIADNE
          How?

                    COBB
          By taking over the creating part.



                    COBB
          This is where you come in. You
          build the world of the dream. We
          take the subject into that dream,
          and let him 111 it with his
          subconscious

                    ARIADNE
          But are you trying to fool him that
          the dream is actually real life?

                     COBB
              (nods)
          While we're in there, We don't want
          him to realize he's dreaming.

                    ARIADNE
          How could I ever get enough detail
          to Convince him that it's real?

                    COBB
          Our dreams reel real while we're in
          them. It's only when we wake up we
          realize things were strange,



                    ARIADNE
          But all the textures of real life-
          the stone, the fabric. cars...
          people... your mind can't create
          all this.

                    COBB
          It does. Every time you dream. Let
          me ask you a question: You never
          remember the beginning of your
          dreams, do you? You just turn up in
          the middle of what's going on.
                                                        32.

                       ARIADNE
          I guess.

                    COBB
          So... how did we end up at this
          restaurant?

                    ARIADNE
          We came here from...



                    COBB
          How did we get here? Where are we?



                    ARIADNE
          Oh my God. We're dreaming.



                    COBB
          Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
          the workshop. This is your first
          lesson in shared dreaming,
          remember?








                    ARIADNE
              (shouting over noise)
          If it's just a dream, why are you
          covering your-

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because it's never just a dream.

                    COBB
          And a face full of glass hurts like
          hell, doesn't it? While we're in
          it, it's real.

                    ARTHUR
          That's why the military developed
          dream sharing-a training program
          where soldiers could strangle, stab
          and shoot each other, then wake up.

                    ARIADNE
          How did architects get involved?

                    COBB
          Someone had to design the dreams.
              (to Arthur)
          Let's go another five minutes-

                    ARIADNE
          We were only asleep for five
          minutes? We talked for an hour at
          least...

                    COBB
          When you dream, your mind functions
          more quickly, so time seems to pass
          more slowly.

                    ARTHUR
          Five minutes in the real world
          gives you an hour in the dream.

                    COBB
          Let's see how much trouble you can
          cause in five minutes.

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY




                    COBB
          It's good. You've got the cafe, the
          layout... you forgot the book shop
          but pretty much everything else is
          here.



                    ARIADNE
          Who are the people?
                                                        34.

                    COBB
          They're projections of my
          subconscious.

                     ARIADNE
          Yours?

                    COBB
          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
          subject. My subconscious populates
          your world. That's one way we get
          at a subject's thoughts-his mind
          creates the people, so we can
          literally talk to his subconscious.

                    ARIADNE
          How else do you do it?

                    COBB
          Architecture. Build a bank vault or
          a jail, something secure, and the
          subject's mind will fill it with
          information he's trying to protect.

                    ARIADNE
          Then you break in and steal it.

                     COBB
          Exactly.



                     ARIADNE
          I love the concrete sense of things-
              (stamps foot)
          Real weight, you know? I thought a
          dream space would be all about the
          visual, but it's the feel of
          things. Question is, what happens
          as you start to mess with
          physics...








                    ARIADNE
          It's something, isn't it?

                    COBB
              (quiet)
          Yes. It is.
                                                        35.




                    ARIADNE
          Why are they looking at me?

                    COBB
          Because you're changing things. My
          subconscious feels that someone
          else is creating the world. The
          more you change things, the quicker
          the projections converge on you.

                      ARIADNE
          Converge?

                    COBB
          They feel the foreign nature of the
          dreamer, and attack-like white
          blood cells fighting an infection.

                    ARIADNE
          They're going to attack us?

                    COBB
          Just you, actually.









                    COBB
          It's beautiful... but if you keep
          on changing things...




                    ARIADNE
          Mind telling your subconscious to
          take it easy?

                    COBB
          That's why it's called subconscious.
          I don't control it.



                    COBB
          Arched stone, iron pillars...
          it's...
                                                          36.






                    COBB
          I know this bridge. This place is
          real-
              (serious)
          You didn't imagine it, you
          remembered it...

                     ARIADNE
              (nods)
          I cross it every day on my way to
          the college.

                    COBB
          Never recreate places from your
          memory. Always imagine new places.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to draw from what you know-

                    COBB
              (tense)
          Use pieces-a streetlamp,
          phonebooths, a type of brick-not
          whole areas.



                     ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    COBB
          Because building dreams out of your
          own memories is the surest way to
          lose your grip on what's real and
          what's a dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Did that happen to you?




                    COBB
          Look, this isn't about me-



                    ARIADNE
          Is that why you need me to build
          your dreams?

          What?

          Some kind of personal icon. A small

          I can't let you handle it. That's

          weight or balance of it.

          Why?

          That's not an issue for me.

          Why not?

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
          going on, maybe you don't want to.
          But Cobb's got problems he's tried
          to bury down there. I'm not going
          to open my mind to someone like
          that.



                    COBB (O.S.)
          She'll be back.



                    COBB
          I've never seen anyone pick it up

          Don't bother telling me it's
          impossible.

                    EAMES
          It's perfectly possible. Just
          bloody difficult.

Arthur? You're still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?

          COBB
He's a good point man.

          EAMES
The best. But he has no
imagination. If you're going to
perform inception, you need
imagination.

          COBB
You've done it before?

          EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the
idea in place, but it didn't take.

          COBB
You didn't plant it deep enough?

          EAMES
It's not just about depth. You need
the simplest version of the idea-
the one that will grow naturally in
the subject's mind. Subtle art.

          COBB
That's why I'm here.

          EAMES
What's the idea you need to plant?

          COBB
We want the heir to a major
corporation to break up his
father's empire.

          EAMES
See, right there you've got various
political motivations, anti-
monopolistic sentiment and so
forth. But all that stuff's at the
mercy of the subject's prejudice-
you have to go to the basic.

            COBB
Which is?

The relationship with the father.

                    ARIADNE
          No paper, no pens... nothing
          between you and raw, direct
          creation.

          three complete dream levels.



                    ARIADNE
          What sort of tricks?



                    ARTHUR
          In a dream, you can cheat
          architecture into impossible
          shapes.
                    (MORE)

                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          That lets you create closed loops,
          like the Penrose Steps. The
          infinite staircase.






                    ARTHUR
          See...




                    ARTHUR
          Paradox. A closed loop like this
          helps you disguise the boundaries
          of the dream you've created.

                    ARIADNE
          How big do the levels have to be?

                    ARTHUR
          Anything from the floor of a
          building, to an entire city. But it
          has to be complicated enough for us
          to hide from the projections.

                    ARIADNE
          A maze.

                    ARTHUR
          And the better the maze-

                    ARIADNE
          The longer we have before the
          projections catch us.



                    ARIADNE
          My subconscious seems polite
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one
          likes to see someone else messing
          around in their mind.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
                                                        47.

                    ARTHUR
          I don't know if he can't, but he
          won't. He thinks it's safer if he
          doesn't know the layouts.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
          I think she's getting stronger.

                    ARIADNE
          His ex-wife?

                    ARTHUR
          She's not his ex.

                    ARIADNE
          They're still together?



                    ARTHUR
          No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What
          you see in there is just his
          projection of her.

                    ARIADNE
          What was she like in real life?

          He's spent his whole life being
          groomed as successor-breaking up
          his father's empire will take a
          radical shift in his thinking.

                    COBB
          What's your problem with Fischer?

                    SAITO
          That's not your concern.

                    COBB
          This isn't the usual corporate
          espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
          inception. The seed of the idea we
          plant will grow in this man's mind.
          It'll change him. It might even
          come to define him.



                    SAITO
          My sources suggest you might not
          have always been so cautious.

                    COBB
          Then you need new sources, Mr.
          Saito.



                    SAITO
          Fischer Morrow has the regulators
          in their pockets. We're the last
          company standing between them and
          total energy dominance and we can
          no longer compete. Soon they'll
          control the energy supply of half
          the world. They'll be able to
          blackmail governments, dictate
          policy. In effect, they become a
          new superpower. The world needs
          Robert Fischer to change his mind.

                    EAMES
          That's where we come in. How's
          Robert Fischer's relationship to
          his father?

                    SAITO
          Rumor is the relationship is
          complicated.

                    COBB
          We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
          Saito.



                     EAMES
          Can you get me access to him?
          Browning. Fischer senior's right-

          It should be possible. If you can
          get the right references.

                    ARIADNE
          You're back.



                    ARIADNE
          Are you going under on your own?

                    COBB
          I just-I need to test some things.
          I didn't realize anyone was here.

                    ARIADNE
          Just working on my totem.



                    COBB
          Let me see-



                    COBB
          You're learning.

                    ARIADNE
          It's an elegant solution to keeping
          track of reality. Your invention?

                       COBB
          No. Mal's.


                                                      55.

                    COBB
          This one was hers. She'd spin it in
          a dream and it would never topple.
          Just spin and spin...

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur told me she died.

                    COBB
          She did. How are the mazes coming?



                    ARIADNE
          Good. Each level relates to the
          part of the subject's subconscious
          we're trying to access. I'm making
          the bottom level a hospital, so
          that Fischer will bring his father
          there-

                    COBB
          Don't tell me. Remember, you only
          want the dreamer to know the
          layout.

                    ARIADNE
          Why's that so important?

                    COBB
          In case one of us brings in part of
          our subconscious. You wouldn't want
          any projections knowing the layout.

                    ARIADNE
          In case you bring Mal in.



                    ARIADNE
          You won't build yourself because if
          you know the maze, then she knows
          it. And she'd sabotage the
          operation. You can't keep her out,
          can you?



                    ARIADNE
          Do the others know?

                     COBB
          No.
                                                        56.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to warn them if it's
          getting worse-

                    COBB
              (gentle)
          I didn't say it's getting worse.
          Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
          job. I need you for this job.
          Without your help, I'll never get
          back to my children. And that's all
          I can care about right now.

                    ARIADNE
          Why can't you go home, Cobb?



                    COBB
          They think I killed her.

                    ARIADNE
          How did she die?





                       COBB
          Thank you.

                       ARIADNE
          For what?

                    COBB
          Not asking whether I did.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY




                    COBB
          The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
          the Australian energy conglomerate,
          Fischer Morrow.



                    COBB (reads aloud)
          "I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S
          EMPIRE."


                                                  57.

                    COBB
          An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
          mind would never accept. We have to
          plant it deep in his subconscious.

                      ARTHUR
          How deep?

                    COBB
          Three levels down.

                    ARTHUR
          A dream within a dream within a
          dream? Is that even possible?

                    COBB
          Yes. It is.

                    COBB
          Now, the subconscious motivates
          through emotion, not reason, so we
          have to translate the idea into an
          emotional concept.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you translate a business
          strategy into an emotion?

                    COBB
          That's what we have to figure out.
          Robert and his father have a tense
          relationship. Worse, even, than the
          gossip columns have suggested...

                    EAMES
          Do you play on that? Suggest
          breaking up his father's company as
          a 'screw you' to the old man?

                    COBB
          No. Positive emotion trumps
          negative emotion every time. We
          yearn for people to be reconciled,
          for catharsis. We need positive
          emotional logic.



                    EAMES
          Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
          I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
          FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

                    COBB
          That might work.
                                                         58.

                    ARTHUR
          Might? We'll have to do better than
          that.

                    EAMES
          Thanks for the contribution,
          Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Forgive me for wanting a little
          specificity, Eames.

                    COBB
          Inception's not about specificity.
          When we get inside his head, we're
          going to have to work with what we
          find.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY




                    EAMES
          We could split the idea into
          emotional triggers, and use one on
          each level.

                    COBB
          How do you mean?

                    EAMES
          On the top level, we open up his
          relationship with his father....
          Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
          FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
          down we've accessed his ambition
          and self-esteem. We feed him: "I
          WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
          Then, the bottom level, we bring
          out the emotional big guns...

                    COBB
          "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
          HIM."

                    EAMES
          That could do it.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you produce these emotional
          triggers?
                                                        59.

                    EAMES
          I forge each emotional concept in
          the style and manner of Peter
          Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
          emotional life.



                    ARTHUR
          Are those yours?



                    ARTHUR
          Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Yup. Sorry.

                    COBB
          Suppress them. We don't bring our
          own projections into the dream-we
          let Fischer's subconscious supply
          the people.

                    EAMES
          Saito, when do I get to see
          Browning?

          I don't want to bother him
          unnecessarily but I know he-

          Robert! I've told you to keep out
          the damn!-







                    BROWNING
          Must be a cherished memory of his-

                    FISCHER
          I put it by his bed. He hasn't even
          noticed.

                    BROWNING
          Robert, we have to talk about a
          power of attorney. I know this is
          hard for you, but it's important
          that we start to think about the
          future-

                    FISCHER
          Not now, Uncle Peter.



                    EAMES (V.O.)
          The vultures are circling. The
          sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the
          stronger Peter Browning becomes...

              (draws a diagram)
          Then we take Fischer down another
          level and his own subconscious

              (impressed)
          So he gives himself the idea.

                    EAMES
          Precisely. That's the only way

          compounded.

                    ARIADNE
          How much time?

                    YUSUF
          Three dreams... that's ten hours,
          times twenty, times twenty, times
          twenty...

                    EAMES
          Math was never my strong suit.

                    COBB
          It's basically a week one layer
          down, six months two layers down-

                    ARIADNE
          And ten years in the third level.
          Who wants to spend ten years in a
          dream?

                    YUSUF
          Depends on the dream.

                     EAMES
          It's not going to take us long to
          crack Fischer open once we get
          going. We'll be out in a couple
          days, max.

                     ARTHUR
          How do we get out once we've made
          the plant?
              (to Cobb)
          I hope you've got something a
          little more elegant in mind than
          shooting me in the head like last
          time.



                    COBB
          A kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What's a kick?




                    EAMES
          That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
                                                          65.

                    COBB
          That feeling of falling which snaps
          you awake. We use that to jolt
          ourselves awake once we're done.

                    ARTHUR
          But how are we going to feel that
          through the sedation?

                    YUSUF
          That's the clever part. I customize
          the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY



                    YUSUF (O.S.)
          To leave inner ear function
          unimpaired...





INT. WORKSHOP - DAY



                    YUSUF
          That way, however deep the sleep, the
          sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY



                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          Or tipping...



INT. WORKSHOP - DAY



                    ARTHUR
          Even that won't cut through three
          layers of deep sleep.

                    COBB
          The trick is to devise a kick for
          each level, then synchronize them
          to get a snap that penetrates all
          three layers.
                                                        66.



                    ARTHUR
          We can use the musical countdown to
          synchronize the different kicks.

          Why do you do this to yourself?

                    COBB
          This is the only way I can still
          dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Is it so important to dream?

                    ARIADNE
          But these aren't just dreams, are
          they? They're memories. You said
          never to use memories.

                    COBB
          And I shouldn't.

                    ARIADNE
          You're keeping her alive.

                    COBB
          No.

          You can't let her go.

                    COBB
          No. These are moments I regret.
          Moments I turned into dreams so I
          could change them.



                    ARIADNE
          What've you got buried down there
          that you regret?



                    COBB
          There's only one thing I need you

                    ARIADNE
          Where is she?

                    COBB
          She'd already died.






                    COBB
          It's James. My boy. He's found
          something. Maybe a worm.



                    COBB
          And there's Philippa.

                    COBB
          I thought about calling out, so
          they'd turn and smile those
          incredible smiles... but I'm out of
          time-



                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.



                    COBB
          Then I panic that I'll always wish
          I'd seen them turn, that I can't
          waste this chance...



                    COBB
          But the moment's passed. And
          whatever I do, the dream's always
          the same... When I'm about to
          call... they run.



                    COBB
          If I'm going to see their faces
          again-I've got to get back here in
          the real world...

                    COBB
          No.

                    EAMES
          He's in agony. Let's wake him up-



                    COBB
          No!
              (they lock eyes)
          It won't wake him up.

                    EAMES
          What do you mean, it won't wake
          him? When you die in a dream you
          wake up.

                    YUSUF
          Not from this. We're too heavily
          sedated to wake up that way.



                    EAMES
          So what happens if one of us dies?

                    COBB
          That person doesn't wake up. Their
          mind drops into Limbo.

                    ARIADNE
          Limbo?

                    ARTHUR
          Unconstructed dream space.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    ARTHUR
          Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing
          there but what was left behind by
          anyone on the team who's been trapped
          there before. On this team... just
          Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          How long would we be stuck there?
                                                        80.

                    YUSUF
          You couldn't even think about
          trying to escape until the sedation
          eases-

                      EAMES
          How long?

                    YUSUF
          Decades-it could be infinite-I
          don't know! Ask him-he's the one
          who's been there before!



                    EAMES
          Great. So now we're stuck in
          Fischer's mind battling it out with
          his private army, and if we get hit
          we're stuck in Limbo 'til our
          brains dissolve into scrambled egg?



                    ARTHUR
          Let's just get him upstairs.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER




                    ARTHUR
          Hold this. Firm pressure.



                    ARTHUR
          You knew the risks and you didn't
          tell us.

                    COBB
          There wasn't meant to be any risk.
          We weren't supposed to be dealing
          with a load of gunnre.

                    ARTHUR
          You had no right.

                    COBB
          It's the only way you can go three
          layers deep, Arthur.


                                                81.

                    ARTHUR
          And you. You went along with this?

                    YUSUF
          I trusted him.

                    ARTHUR
          You trusted him? When? When he
          promised you half his share?

                    YUSUF
              (offended)
          No! His whole share. Plus, he told
          me he'd done it before.



                    ARTHUR
          Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out
          great, didn't it, Cobb?



                    COBB
          You don't know anything about that.
          This was the only way to do this
          job, Arthur. I did what I had to do
          to get back to my children.

                    EAMES
          So you led us into a war zone with
          no way out.

                    COBB
          We have a way out. The kick. We
          just have to push on, do the job as
          fast as possible and get out using
          the kick.

                    EAMES
          Forget it. We go any deeper, we
          just raise the stakes. I'm sitting
          it out on this level.

                    COBB
          You'll never make it, Eames.
          Fischer's security is surrounding
          this place as we speak. The ten
          hours of the flight is a week at
          this level-you'll never make it
          without getting killed. Downwards
          is the only way forwards. We have
          to carry on.


                                                           82.

                    COBB
          And we have to do it fast.



                    COBB
          Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's
          get in there and soften him up.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER




                    FISCHER
          I'm insured against kidnapping up
          to ten million-this'll be simple-

                    COBB
          No, it won't.



                    ARTHUR
          In. your lather's office, below the
          bookshelves, is his personal safe.
          We need the combination.

                    FISCHER
          I never noticed a safe-

                    COBB
          Doesn't mean you don't know the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          Well, I don't.

                    ARTHUR
          We have it on good authority that
          you do.

                    FISCHER
          Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS




                    YUSUF
          Five hundred dollars, this cost?

                    EAMES
          What's inside?
                                                        83.

          Cash, cards, ID... and this-






                    EAMES
          Useful?





                    COBB
          You're on. You've got an hour.

                    EAMES
          An hour? I was supposed to have all
          night to crack him.

                    COBB
          And Saito was supposed to keep his
          guts on the inside. You've got an
          hour-get something we can use.




INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS



                    FISCHER
          What's that?

                    ARTHUR
          Good authority.



                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-

                    ARTHUR
          The combination.

                    FISCHER
          I don't know it!

                    ARTHUR
          Why would Browning tell us you did?

                    FISCHER
          Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
                                                        84.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER





                    COBB
          You've got an hour. Get talking.



                    BROWNING (EAMES)
          They've had me for two days.
          They've got someone with access to
          your father's office and they're
          trying to open his safe-they
          thought I'd know the combination,
          but I don't-

                    FISCHER
          Neither do I, Uncle Peter.

                    BROWNING
              (confused)
          Maurice told me that after he
          passed only you would be able to
          open it.

                    FISCHER
          He never gave me the combination.



                    BROWNING
          He did, he just didn't tell you
          that it was a combination.

                    FISCHER
          What, then?

                    BROWNING
          Something only you would know. Some
          meaningful combination of numbers
          from your experiences with Maurice-

                    FISCHER
          We didn't have a lot of meaningful
          experiences together.

                    BROWNING
          Perhaps after your mother died...

                    FISCHER
          After my mother died, I went to him
          in my grief.

                                                        85.
                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          You know what he told me? "There's
          really nothing to be said, Robert."

                     BROWNING
          He always had a hard time with
          emotional-

                    FISCHER
          I was eleven, Uncle Peter.



                    BROWNING
          He loved you, Robert. In his way.

                    FISCHER
          "In his way?" At the end he called
          me to his deathbed. He could barely
          speak, but he took the trouble to
          say one last thing to me. He pulled
          me close... I could make out only
          one word. "Disappointed."



INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS




                    COBB
          How's he doing?

                    ARIADNE
          He's in a lot of pain.



                    COBB
          When we get you down to the next
          level, the pain will be less
          intense.



                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          And if he dies?

                    COBB
          His conscious mind will drop out of
          the dream. He'll be trapped in
          Limbo for a lifetime...

                    ARIADNE
          What will that do to him?
                                                           86.



                    COBB
          When he wakes... his mind could be
          completely gone.

                    SAITO
          When... when we wake I will still
          honor our arrangement...



                    COBB
          Saito-san, when you wake you might
          not even remember that we had an
          arrangement. You'll have forgotten
          this world. Limbo will be your
          reality. Lost there so long, you'll
          have become an old man...

                    SAITO
          Filled with regret?

                    COBB
          Waiting to die alone. Yes.

                    SAITO
          Then I'll take the chance and come
          back. And we'll be young men
          together again.



                    ARIADNE
          When were you trapped in Limbo?



                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, you might have convinced the
          rest of this team to carry on with
          the job. But they don't know the
          truth.

                    COBB
          What truth?

                    ARIADNE
          The truth that at any minute you
          might bring a freight train through
          the wall. The truth that Mal is
          bursting up through your
          subconscious.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          The truth that as we go deeper into
          Fischer, we're also going deeper
          into you-and I'm not sure we're
          going to like what we find there.



                    ARIADNE
          This is not just about Fischer,
          it's about you. Tell me what
          happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
          Limbo.



                    COBB
          We were on a job. Exploring dreams
          within dreams. But we didn't
          understand how your mind can turn
          hours into years. How you can get
          trapped. Trapped so deep that when
          you wash up on the shore of your
          subconscious...




                    COBB
          You can lose track of what's real.

                    ARIADNE
          How long were you stuck?



                    COBB
          Fifty years.



                    ARIADNE
          How did you stand it?



                    COBB
          We built. We created a whole world
          for ourselves...


                    COBB
          It's not so bad at first, being
          gods. The problem is knowing that
          it's not real. It became impossible
          for me to live like that.
                                                        88.

                    ARIADNE
          But not for her?

                    COBB
          She accepted it. At some point...

                    ARIADNE
          And when you finally woke up?

                    COBB
          To wake from that. From decades
          lived. To be old souls thrown back
          into youth. It was hard. At first
          Mal seemed okay. But I started to
          realize something was wrong.
          Finally she admitted it. This idea
          she was possessed by. This simple
          little idea that changed
          everything...

                    ARIADNE
          What was it?

                    COBB
          That our world was not real. No
          matter what I did, no matter what I
          said, she was convinced that we
          were still in a dream. That we
          needed to wake up again...

          They're projections, Dom. Your

          No. I'm going to jump. And you're

          No, I'm not. This is real-if you
          jump, you're not going to wake up,
          you're going to die. Let's go back

          jump right now.

          I'm asking you to take a leap of
          faith.

          I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave

          He letter to the authorities
          refuted all the claims about her
          sanity that she knew I'd make...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)



                    COBB (V.O.)
          She'd had herself declared sane by
          three different psychiatrists.




                    COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was impossible for me to explain
          the nature of her madness...



                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.





                    COBB (V.O.)
          So I ran. And I've been running
          ever since, trying to buy my way
          back to my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY



                    ARIADNE
          Psychiatrists judged her sane?

                    COBB
          She was sane. She was just lost in
          the labyrinth.

                    ARIADNE
          Then why should you blame yourself?

                    COBB
          Because we were a family. And we
          had a life I would do anything to
          get back to now. But that reality
          wasn't enough for me then.
                                                        93.

                    ARIADNE
          It might have been your idea to
          push the limits, Cobb. But you're
          not responsible for the idea that
          destroyed her. The idea that her
          world wasn't real... that was her
          own idea from her own mind.



                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Your guilt defines her. Powers her.
          If we're going to succeed in this,
          you're going to have to forgive
          yourself, and you're going to have
          to confront her. But you don't have
          to do it alone.

                    COBB
          You don't have to do this for me-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm doing it for the others. They
          don't know the risk they've taken
          coming in here with you.

          Maurice's will is with Port and

          the other only if you want it to.

                    FISCHER
          What does it say?

                    BROWNING

          individual companies, transferring

          A basic living. Nothing more. The
          entire empire would cease to exist.

          Destroy my own inheritance? Why
          would he suggest such a thing?

          Sure. But it didn't work. The

          Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
          to the strangeness of the dream.
          That's making his subconscious look
          for the dreamer. For me.

          But I can explain all this. You've

          Your body's bouncing around in the

          It's like trying to remember a

          takes years of practice to do it
          easily. So, you and Browning have
          been pulled into this dream so they
          can steal something from your mind.
          What?

                    FISCHER
          They wanted a combination to a
          safe... they demanded the first
          numbers to pop into my head.

                    COBB
          That's them extracting a locator.

                    FISCHER
          What taunt?

                    BROWNING
          That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but
          it's his final insult. A challenge
          to build something for yourself.
          He's telling you that you aren't
          worthy of his achievements.



                    FISCHER
          That he was "disappointed?"

          greater than he ever could.

          Browning's so he'd come with us as
          part of our team.

                    ARTHUR

          That's the idea. He'll think that
          his security is Browning's and
          fight them to learn the truth about
          his father.




                    COBB
          Fischer's subconscious is going to
          run you down hard.

          Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
          jump, which gives Arthur about
          three minutes, which gives us about-

                    ARIADNE
          Sixty minutes.

                    COBB
          The route you gave them, can they
          do it in under an hour?

          I don't think so. They've still got
          to climb down to the middle
          terrace.

          They need a new route-a direct
          route.

          add any large pipes or-

                    ARIADNE
          Ducts. He added an air duct system-
          it doesn't follow the maze. They
          can use it to go straight from the

          So... have you come to kill me?



                    SAITO
          I've been waiting for someone to
          come for me...

                    COBB
          Someone from your half-remembered
          dream...?



                    SAITO
          Cobb? Not possible-he and I were
          young men together. And I am an old
          man...

                    COBB
          Filled with regret?



                    SAITO
          Waiting to die alone, yes.



                    COBB
          I came back for you... I came to
          remind you of what you once knew...




                    COBB
          That this world is not real.

                    SAITO
          You came to convince me to honor
          our arrangement?

                    COBB
          Yes. And to take a leap of faith.




                    COBB
          Come back and we'll be young men
          together again.
