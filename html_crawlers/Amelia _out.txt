The face at once strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. Yet just now, there are none to be seen. Even as... ...a door OPENS. A pretty SECRETARY enters soundlessly, sits respectfully. Waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad. Does he know she's there?	GEORGE	 (without turning) The first time I met her she sat in that chair. The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And still with his back to her...	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 You may as well write it down, Mary. Write it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring. He turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 We'll see if I remember how to edit. She smiles back. She likes him, as much as her level of being awed by him permits. She begins to write, as...	Amelia 
GEORGE	 Miss Earhart?	AMELIA	 Mr. Putnam? GEORGE (softly) I asked you to sit.	AMELIA	 Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog. His smile now only a trace.       But more genuine.	GEORGE	 A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like. melia sits.	Amelia 
AMELIA (CONT'D)	 You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well...	OCTOPUS CLUB	 (on cue)	REALLY STRANGE!		AMELIA	 They are, actually. She pats the grass beside her.   Sam has no choice but to sit.	Amelia 
AMELIA (CONT'D)	 Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything.	GEORGE	 (a smile) Simpkin.	AMELIA	 It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching.	14                                                              14		Amelia 
GEORGE	 Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam. The women trade smiles.   They shake hands, holding eye contact.	DOROTHY	 Great to meet you. George talks so much about you. (a wink) In fact, lately, you're all he does talk about.	PHOTOGRAPHER	 Hold those smiles for one more, please.			Amelia 
BILL	 You're serious.	AMELIA	 Just as serious as you're hung over. (to Slim) You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane. Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his commander.	AMELIA (CONT'D)		(QUIET)	 Slim, get out. I've got this. A beat. Slim goes, the door shuts quietly.     Amelia sits on the edge of Bill's bed.	Amelia 
AMELIA	 I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise...	REPORTER	 (calls out) But you can fly, can't you? Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas.	AMELIA	 This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record.	REPORTER	 So you could have done it yourself!	Amelia 
GEORGE	 ou're the boss.	DOROTHY	 Hey, that's my job. (to Amelia) Do you think there's enough of him to boss for the two of us? Amelia still looking at George.    Laughs.	AMELIA	 Barely enough for one. A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade.	REPORTER	 Miss Earhart, can you tell us some- thing about your future plans?	Amelia 
GEORGE (CONT'D)	 This week's marriage proposals. The top one's the most creative. It's from Sing Sing. She starts to read.    Her eyes widen.   Goodness. AMELIA (reads) `...in the prison yard, so everyone can watch and share in our...' ( looks up) Did you write the copy on this one, too? DOROTHY (O.S., approaching) Have you no shame, George? No sense of the scandal you create? They look up.   She has a tray of lemonade and cookies.	DOROTHY (CONT'D)	 You make her work for nothing. At least you can feed her. (to Amelia) Are you done yet? If not, make him write the rest, he will anyway.					Amelia 
ELINOR (CONT'D)	 What I mean is. It's a good thing. That's why I want it. Now our couple is trying not to laugh.	GEORGE	 Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? ELINOR (straight back) To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot. The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically dumbstruck.	AMELIA	 Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip?	ELINOR	 I do.	Amelia 
GEORGE	 If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me. He seems so sunny and strong.     What can he be feeling?	AMELIA	 I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you. GEORGE (a murmur) Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse. S he comes close enough to kiss.	AMELIA	 I know me.     And you don't.   Not really.			Amelia

Though less than a year has passed, she seems much older. Sophisticated, poised. ANGLE. A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to George's office. As they enter, George is pacing on the phone.              G EORGE (into phone) Because Amelia invented the Powder Puff Derby for female pilots. Then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the Rockies so they won't crash into the mountains! Listens, impatient.	ELINOR	 Wish I was important enough for you to manage.	GEORGE	 Well, I've just got one client. And most days she's more than I can manage. Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety.			Amelia 
GEORGE	 he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true.	AMELIA	 And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE (calm, straight) Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this.	AMELIA	 What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work?	GEORGE	 I didn't say that.	Amelia 
48                                                                    48	 George at the breakfast table. His eggs and toast ignored for the moment, he's reading a magazine article. PAN to Amelia, sipping her coffee. Watching him. GEORGE (reads aloud) `Why I Believe Women Pilots Can't Fly The Atlantic. An outspoken warning by Lady Heath.'	(READING)	 `...pure suicide for any woman today...it is madness for them to attempt it and...' He looks up to her.	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 `...at least the first dozen will be drowned.' And we're reading A this, because...?			Amelia 
GEORGE (CONT'D)	 So the Simpkin thing. What was all that?	AMELIA	 I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? He shakes his head. GEORGE (very soft) Either way, something to look forward to. She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave him either.	AMELIA (CONT'D)	 See ya.			Amelia

The door opens softly...	SECRETARY (O.S.)	 Mr. Putnam? Line three. He turns and looks at her. The girl's eyes go down and he BOLTS to the phone, SNATCHES the receiver, SLAMS the button... GEORGE (into phone) Putnam.	VOICE (O.S.)	 Sir, this is Douglas McGuire of the Press Association. I'm sorry to tell you that Miss Earhart's plane has crashed in a field, short of Le Bourget airport.			Amelia 
MAN (CONT'D)	 Where are ya supposed to be?	AMELIA	 When I left, I was aiming for Paris. Oh. MAN (very sad) Ya missed, y'know.	(POINTS)	 It's over there.			Amelia

From the stage, a speaker DRONES, but backstage... ...George peeks out at the throng. When he looks back, we see Amelia, her troubled face. The folded newspaper in her hand. G W W	GEORGE	 ell, I'm glad someone besides me finally noticed. His smile is light.    Her eyes watching him.   Then... AMELIA (reads) `Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.' She stares at the paper.    His voice comes gently...	GEORGE	 hy would you even read that garbage?	AMELIA	 Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble.	Amelia 
AMELIA	 What are you trying to say?	GEORGE	 I think I've just said it. A long held look.       Neither backing away.   Sadness on both sides. GEORGE (softly) Is there anything you want to say? She sighs.       Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with affection.	AMELIA	 I can't think of anything helpful. He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly... Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She stares after him. H e disappears into the house.       She's still staring.			Amelia

Gene enters the room with a drink in his hand and sits down next to her, concerned by her obvious distress. AMELIA (into the phone) I'm so glad you have it now.	(LISTENS)	 S			Amelia 
GENE	 I'm sorry I said it that way. This s actually about you, because I'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about.	AMELIA	 And what's your point? Women are eld to some higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? ENE (quietly) Of course they are.	AMELIA	 Well, let's change that, shall we? r would you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier. Staring at each other.	GENE	 If you want to make money, my guess s that people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful.	Amelia 
AMELIA (CONT'D)	 Because she can't help. All she can be is dependent. Because that I s what she's been trained to be. A phone RINGS. One of the girls snatches it up to cut off the interruption.

AMELIA(CONT'D)	 This showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted...	(SNIFFLES)	 They thought I was competent. GEORGE (softly) I meant.    Or maybe we can quit. She looks over.    Not sure if...	AMELIA	 You mean after.	GEORGE	 Or.     Even now. A strong smile.    He nods.     We could.	Amelia 
AMELIA	 And then what?	GEORGE	 Then the best part.    The future. She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him. AMELIA (a whisper) Oh yeh.    That. She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep. Longing. Her body sinks into him. LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other.					Amelia 
AMELIA	 Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it's all about her. Staring at each other.	GEORGE	 And one of them.    Is right. AMELIA (a murmur) She knows. And then...	GEORGE	 want you to give me something. He's never sounded quite like this before.	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 Tell me this is your last flight. Her eyes flicker.     Look down.   A whispered...	Amelia 
AMELIA	 We can't possibly afford this.	GEORGE	 ure, we can. It's Tuesday's call o Lae that we can't afford. AMELIA (delighted) You hang up the phone this minute. You'll bankrupt us and I'll have to walk home.	GEORGE	 easoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. Her eyes remember.    A soft...	AMELIA	 ..and it's fun.	Amelia

He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't understand. AMELIA (gently) Feel like stepping out for a smoke...?	BALFOUR	 I don't smoke.	AMELIA	 ...or something? Oh.   The monsoon beats down.	Amelia 
GEORGE	 I'm running a big adventure here, 'm a very important fellow.	AMELIA	 You told me I was the star.   And you were no one at all. GEORGE (soft) I thought I was lying. Guess the joke's on me. Silence.	GEORGE (CONT'D)	 How's Fred?	AMELIA	 I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay?	Amelia 
AMELIA	 t's late here. Guess I'll go curl up under a teacup.	GEORGE	 I'll go tell the world you're on your way. Neither wants to let go.      We feel it so strong. GEORGE (a whisper) Sweet dreams. A beat. AMELIA (whispers back) See ya. And he's gone.      She stares at the radio.					Amelia
