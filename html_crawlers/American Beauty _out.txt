JANE	 I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.	RICKY (O.C.)	 Want me to kill him for you?	JANE	 (deadpan) Yeah, would you?			American Beauty 
RICKY (O.C.)	 Want me to kill him for you?	JANE	 (deadpan) Yeah, would you?					American Beauty 
LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)	 And that's his lover, Jim.	JIM #2	 (re: barking dog) What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this morning.	JIM #1	 And a jerky treat.	JIM #2	 You spoil her. (sternly) Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.	American Beauty 
JIM #1	 Morning, Carolyn.	CAROLYN	 (overly friendly) I just love your tie! That color!	JIM #1	 I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this?	CAROLYN	 Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.	American Beauty 
BRAD	 Exactly. So...	LESTER	 (blurts) Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months?	BRAD	 (startled) That's unsubstantiated gossip.	LESTER	 That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

BRAD	 Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and--	American Beauty 
BRAD	 It's just business.	LESTER	 (angry) I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month?	BRAD	 (frank) I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job.			American Beauty

JANE	 Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?	CAROLYN	 (considers) No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.	LESTER	 So Janie, how was school?	JANE	 (suspicious) It was okay.	American Beauty 
LESTER	 So Janie, how was school?	JANE	 (suspicious) It was okay.	LESTER	 Just okay?	JANE	 No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.	American Beauty 
LESTER (CONT'D)	 They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us-- (off her look) --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you?	JANE	 (uncomfortable) Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.	JANE (CONT'D)	 I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken to me for months.	LESTER	 Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee.	American Beauty 
LESTER	 Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee.	CAROLYN	 (taken aback) What?!	CAROLYN (CONT'D)	 (more authority) What?	LESTER	 I'm going to get some ice cream.	American Beauty 
WOMAN #2	 There's not even any plants out here.	CAROLYN	 (re: shrub) What do you call this? Is this not a plant? If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape architect. Solved.	WOMAN #2	 I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, I think tropical. This is a cement hole.	CAROLYN	 I have some tiki torches in the garage.	American Beauty 
ANNOUNCER	 (over P.A.) And now, for your half-time entertainment, Rockwell High's award- winning Dancing Spartanettes!	LESTER	 We can leave right after this, right?					American Beauty

ANGELA	 (warming) Thanks.	CAROLYN	 (to Angela) Nice to meet you, Angela. (to Jane) Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you very closely, and you didn't screw up once. (then, to Lester) Okay, we have to go.	LESTER	 So, what are you girls doing now?	JANE	 Dad.	American Beauty 
LESTER	 Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great! That's great, because Janie's thinking about getting a car soon too, aren't you, honey?	JANE	 (you freak) Dad. Mom's waiting for you.

COLONEL	 Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are you guys selling?	JIM #2	 (after a beat) Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors--	COLONEL	 Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're partners. So what's your business?	JIM #1	 Well, he's a tax attorney.	American Beauty 
RICKY	 Hey.	BARBARA	 (out of the blue) I'm sorry, what?	RICKY	 Mom. Nobody said anything.	BARBARA	 Oh. I'm sorry.	American Beauty

CATERING BOSS	 Asshole.	LESTER	 I think you just became my personal hero. (then) Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?	RICKY	 Eighteen. (then) I just do these gigs as a cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.

JANE	 You are so grossing me out right now.	ANGELA	 (really enjoying this) If he built up his chest and arms, I would totally fuck him.					American Beauty 
JANE	 Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.	ANGELA	 (intrigued) Really?					American Beauty 
RICKY	 Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz.	COLONEL	 Yeah, I suppose. (an awkward beat) Well. Good night, son.					American Beauty 
LESTER	 I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm ready.	CAROLYN	 (furious) Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin!	LESTER	 On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.	LESTER (CONT'D)	 Turn out the light when you come to bed, okay?	American Beauty 
JIM #2	 Lester, I didn't know you ran.	LESTER	 (panting) Well, I just started.	JIM #1	 Good for you.	LESTER	 I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.	American Beauty

RICKY	 I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know.	LESTER	 (re: urine sample) What is this?	RICKY	 Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean.	LESTER	 Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night.	American Beauty 
LESTER	 I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce?	RICKY	 (indicates bag) Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred.	LESTER	 Wow.

LESTER	 Thanks.	RICKY	 (hands him a bag) There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash.

RICKY	 That sucks.	LESTER	 No actually, it was great. All I did was party and get laid. (smiles) I had my whole life ahead of me...	RICKY	 My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs. (off Lester's look) Never underestimate the power of denial.			American Beauty

BRAD	 (reads) "...my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring to the men's room so I can jerk off, while I fantasize about a life that doesn't so closely resemble hell." (looks up at Lester) Well, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.	LESTER	 (laughs) Brad, for fourteen years I've been a whore for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.	BRAD	 Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.	LESTER	 Well, just what sort of severance package is "management" prepared to offer me?	American Beauty 
BRAD	 Man. You are one twisted fuck.	LESTER	 (standing) Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose.					American Beauty

BUDDY	 (bitterly) Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw.

CAROLYN	 Buddy. I'm so sorry.	BUDDY	 (bitterly) Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw.

JANE	 Sorry I'm late.	CAROLYN	 (overly cheerful) No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. (to Lester) Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey?	LESTER	 Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus.	CAROLYN	 Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.	American Beauty 
LESTER	 And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink.	CAROLYN	 (ashen) How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job!	LESTER	 Lose it? I didn't lose it.

JANE	 Aw, Christ, Mom.	CAROLYN	 (tearful) No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself.

CAROLYN	 You ungrateful little brat. Just look at everything you have. When I was your age, I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have our own house.	American Beauty

There is plenty of joy in my life.	LESTER	 (leaning toward her) Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I haven't.	CAROLYN	 (barely audible) Lester. You're going to spill beer on the couch.	American Beauty

JANE (CONT'D)	 Tell me about being in the hospital.	RICKY	 When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school.

Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off. (then) That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.	JANE	 Wow. You must really hate him.	RICKY	 He's not a bad man.	American Beauty

JANE	 Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?	CAROLYN	 Well, of course, she's always welcome. (on her way out) You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while.	LESTER	 What?	JANE	 (nervous) I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave.	American Beauty 
LESTER	 What?	JANE	 (nervous) I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave.	LESTER	 What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.	JANE	 (angry) Dad! You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk! It's disgusting!	American Beauty 
LESTER	 What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.	JANE	 (angry) Dad! You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk! It's disgusting!

BUDDY	 I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for a while. I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.	CAROLYN	 Oh, no. I understand completely. (sarcastic) In order to be successful, one must project an image of success. At all times.	CAROLYN (CONT'D)	 Stop it. Stop it!			American Beauty
