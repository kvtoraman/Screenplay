We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.	JOE (CONT'D)	 Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure they're well behaved.  All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.	JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)	 I'm looking forward to meeting you, too.
