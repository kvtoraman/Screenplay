HOWARD COSELL	 ...cannot stand you, Cassius.   He really wants to kill you...	CASSIUS	 Howard Cosell, you are an instigator! (Cosell smiles) How you get that way?

Minister Malcolm...what about the reports of a split between you and Elijah Muhammad?	Ali

MALCOLM X	 Next Thursday.	CASSIUS	 (sees) What is it?	MALCOLM X	 You ever been so angry...have you ever been so angry that you'd explode?	CASSIUS	 (after a beat) Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan.

MALCOLM X	 What else?	CASSIUS	 I thought, "What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was.	Ali 
CASSIUS	 I thought, "What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was.	MALCOLM X	 ...when I heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham? (beat) The prohibitions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table... But dead children...are dead children. So the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. "I'm having a stroke," I thought. I had to hold it in 'cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a part...any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a human being. In your spirit. In your heart... At the death of children. But I COULD DO...nothing.	MALCOLM X (CONT'D)	 (putting his glasses back on) Everyone knows... Now I'm advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle... So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as a Minister in the Nation of Islam for 90 days.	CASSIUS	 You can fix that...	Ali 
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD	 Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people...is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali...which means "one worthy of praise," and Ali means "most high."	CASSIUS	 (a beat, sounding it) Muhammad Ali. (humble) "Worthy of praise..." Thank you!	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD	 (cautioning) Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now.	CASSIUS	 Yes, sir.	Ali 
CASSIUS	 (a beat, sounding it) Muhammad Ali. (humble) "Worthy of praise..." Thank you!	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD	 (cautioning) Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now.	CASSIUS	 Yes, sir.	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD	 (after a beat) Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother Malcolm. (beat) I do not feel this is a wise course anymore.	Ali 
CASSIUS	 Yes, sir.	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD	 (after a beat) Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother Malcolm. (beat) I do not feel this is a wise course anymore.	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D)	 Malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words. I have decided to give you, as your guide, my very own son, Herbert Muhammad.	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D)	 Herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs.	Ali

Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle Street... (angrily) They saved you from the gangsters, from the jackals and the hyenas of boxing. Never cheated you. Protected you with a trust fund...	ALI	 I don't need no "protectin'" from myself. Why I need protecting from myself by them...?	ALI	 I ain't one of their thoroughbreds! Or their charity things. "Let's do somethin' for that well-behaved colored boy, Cassius." I ain't well-behaved nothing! I am a man.	Ali 
ALI	 I know who I'm not...I'm not drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife! I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't...	ODESSA CLAY	 ...dinner! (cold) Go ahead!	CASSIUS CLAY, SR. (CONT'D)	 Go ahead.	ODESSA CLAY	 You didn't get it from me...your words, your sense of humor, what makes you angry, what makes you a fighter. You got that from your daddy...	Ali 
MALCOLM X	 What is it, Joseph?	JOSEPH 13X (V.O.)	 The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given the Muslim name, Muhammad Ali, to Cassius X. Herbert Muhammad's been placed in charge of his training, instead of you. (and ultimately) Muhammad Ali will not be traveling with you to Africa.	JOSEPH 13X (V.O.)

MALCOLM X	 And I heard you were coming.	ALI	 We just got here now... (words rush out) And, maaan, the brothers were flyin' a DC 8. Flippin' switches, navigatin', filing flight plans, talkin' French...	ALI (CONT'D)	 Where you goin'?	MALCOLM X	 When...uh, Liberia.   When you fighting Liston?	Ali 
ALI	 Man, where should I go?   We're planning on Egypt.	MALCOLM X	 Algeria. See Ben Bella... (beat) Go to Mecca, Medina. I just came back. Made my seven circuits around the Kaaba, prayed at sunrise... There were two million people...pilgrims from all over. Dressed all the same, high and low, the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed Muslims.

ALI	 (stays angry) You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school?	HOWARD COSELL	 Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you.	ALI	 I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth.	Ali 
ALI	 I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth.	HOWARD COSELL	 (fast) And without me...you'd be a mouth.	HOWARD COSELL (CONT'D)	 (into camera) We'll be right back.			Ali

The jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable...five years' imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars. (pause) Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal.

ALI	 Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth...middle of Times Square...you think that draw a crowd?	CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE	 Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd, Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses. They don't want you to fight. (so much for speculation) ACLU's handling your case against the New York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York's got actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked yours...?	ALI	 Tijuana?	CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE	 No. State Department refused permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look...	Ali

Business men, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line, know what any of it is worth."			Ali 
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE	 I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that...	ALI	 Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty. Put aside "how do that happen"? Licenses all revoked. No passport. I can't fight here. Can't fight abroad. (beat) And what happen if I lose the Supreme Court?	CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE	 It's all over. You go to jail for five years.			Ali 
BINGHAM	 Ellis doesn't belong in there.	ALI	 (curt) Man give him a shot, he took a shot.	BINGHAM	 I saw Bundini in New York.	ALI	 How's he?	Ali 
BINGHAM	 You call your parents, Ali?	BELINDA	 No, he didn't. I told them about the one on the way...myself. (moves to the kitchen)	BINGHAM	 You p-p-p-promised you'd call them.	ALI	 I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em... (re: the baby) May-may! It go in one end and come out the other.	Ali

Everybody know I'm the champ. The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie. Joe Frazier know it's a lie. It time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth.	HOWARD COSELL	 Let's tell it like it is. With your court and boxing problems, Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted?	Ali 
HOWARD COSELL	 You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you...	ALI	 I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself. (beat) And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down.	ELIJAH MUHAMMAD	 Get me my son, Herbert, on the telephone!			Ali 
ALI	 Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor?	LANDLADY	 (following behind) Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you...and to call you, Mr. Ali... He's not been out for three days...	BINGHAM	 Bundini!	BUNDINI	 (opens his eyes; half sits) Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog!	Ali

BUNDINI	 (demonstrates more) God don't care about you! Don't care about me! In all of everything, we mean nothin'. He don't know us. We be. And that's the onliest thing he did. And that's good 'cause that's why we free. But free ain't easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker... (low; almost spooky) It eats raw meat. (beat) It walk in its own shoes.

I'm filled with weakness and got a crazy mind. That belt say you the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Five hundred dollars and I put it into my arm. That's what I called to tell you...	BUNDINI (CONT'D)	 ...heard 'bout the Nation, all that court stuff.	Ali 
BUNDINI (CONT'D)	 ...heard 'bout the Nation, all that court stuff.	ALI	 (absent) Yeah.	BUNDINI	 Forgive me, Muhammad.    Take me back...	ALI	 No. There's no "back" to take you to...	Ali 
REVERSE:    PAST ALI	 The city recedes. Vectors, in perspective, carry structures, buildings away. The sky is grey, going to blue. The city flees and SUDDENLY disappears as we race into the dark tunnel of subway. Ali's lost in the depths of attempting a calculation. He can't do that for which he has a genius beyond other men...	ALI	 (to himself) ...you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me?	OVER ALI:    WHITE LIGHT				Ali 
ALI (O.S.)	 A thousand dollars to the man who brings me Howard Cosell's toupee! Dead or alive!	HOWARD COSELL	 (loud) Don't bother me. I'm a world- famous broadcaster and you're an ex-champion with diminished skills. I can't be seen you, it would be calamitous to my reputation.					Ali 
HOWARD COSELL	 You surprise me, Muhammad...	ALI	 Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it! (beat) I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender.	HOWARD COSELL	 Do you think you're going to jail?	ALI	 I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing.	Ali 
HOWARD COSELL	 Joe Frazier told me on this show he would knock you out.	ALI	 There you go, agitatin'. (beat) You ask Smokin' Joe what he been smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better wake up and apologize... (pause) But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe, here's what you might see... (recites) Ali comes out to meet Frazier, but Frazier starts to retreat; If Frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; Ali swings with a left, Ali swings with a right. Frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. It a matter of time before Ali lowers the boom; Now Ali lands with a right, what	ALI (CONT'D)	 a beautiful swing, But the punch lifts Frazier clean out of the ring. Frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'Cause he can't start countin' 'til Frazier come down. And Frazier's disappeared from view. And the crowd is getting frantic. Then our radar stations pick him up. He's somewhere over the Atlantic. Who would have thought when they came to this fight, That they would witness the launching of a black satellite?	ALI (CONT'D)	 But don't wait for they fight. 'Cause it ain't never gonna happen. You only can wonder and imagine...	Ali 
FRAZIER	 What I got to do?	ALI	 You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot. (puts it to him) So what you say...maaan?	FRAZIER	 My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a slaughterhouse...right on that corner. I came up from nothing. (raises fist) What I got, I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win and everything to lose.	ALI	 But you know you ain't the champ yet.	Ali

FRAZIER (CONT'D)	 (quieter) You need any money or anything to tide you by...?	ALI	 (turns away) I'm fine. Thanks.					Ali 
ALI	 You want me to take you back?	BUNDINI	 I'm clean. (beat) And you a resurrection. This is God's act. Anybody love poor people and little people and fucked-up people gotta be a prophet.	BUNDINI (CONT'D)	 And the prophet is going home. You the sun. Let me live in the light. (pause) Take me with, boss. (beat) ...I'll do anything.	ALI	 (quietly) You can't hit what you can't see.	Ali

DON KING	 (over the drumming) Champ! Champ! George had an accident.	ANGELO DUNDEE	 (suspicious) What are you talking about?	DON KING	 Got cut. Right above his right eye. His sparring partner's elbow. Split it open, so...	ANGELO DUNDEE	 Can he fight?	Ali 
ANGELO DUNDEE	 Are you tryin' to pull something, Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves, he ain't comin' back. George don't like it here.	DON KING	 How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water.

ALI (CONT'D)	 The whole world was gonna know. But, now, he ain't gonna show. That's why he knocked hisself out when he was training.	DON KING	 (laughs to dismiss Ali) We will reschedule the fight, and to ensure George is ready, we are thinking of postponing from September 24th to October 30th.	REPORTER	 What about the concert, Don?	DON KING	 That would go off as planned on September 22nd and 23rd.	Ali 
DON KING	 That would go off as planned on September 22nd and 23rd.	ALI	 (skeptical) Uh-huh. I want all helicopters guarded! Private boats. Private jets. I want the airport -- I'm serious -- I want President Mobutu and all his paratroopers. Mobutu and all his paratroopers. I want all of you "Zaireans" to be on guard! Watch all strange boats tryin' to slip away! They might be takin' him out.	ANGELO DUNDEE	 The bus station. It's Ali kidding on the square. A serious point delivered not seriously to be taken seriously.	ALI	 Yeah. Watch the bus station. Watch everything! Elephant caravans. He might sneak out by elephant.	Ali
