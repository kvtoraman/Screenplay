MAYFIELD	 Robert, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot...	ROBERT	 No, no, no. Forget it, forget it... Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of (sotto from the waitress pouring his coffee) 18 Million? (returns to volume) And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars?

MAYFIELD	 Are you serious?	ROBERT	 (ripping off the tablecloth) I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. Mayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu. Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket.	MAYFIELD	 I'll send over a draft of the press release. As Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib.	MAYFIELD (CONT'D)	 Are you all right?	Arbitrage 
MAYFIELD	 So we made a good deal.	ROBERT	 (as he heads away) Yeah. Robert turns back to the table.	ROBERT (CONT'D)	 Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. Mayfield shrugs and returns to his paper. Robert walks out of the restaurant, beaming. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83.			Arbitrage 
ROBERT (PRE-LAP)	 Hello. INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT Reina, Jimmy's girlfriend (24, Hispanic) stands at the door with Robert and Jimmy. She turns and heads to the bedroom. Jimmy heads to the kitchen.	JIMMY	 You want something to drink?	ROBERT	 What you got?			Arbitrage

What about my situation? (off his silence) They showed me pictures, man; that's fucked up what you did. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87.	ROBERT		(SOTTO)	 It was an accident.	Arbitrage 
JIMMY	 Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose.	ROBERT	 (nods, stands) Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. Jimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the living room as he approaches the door and exits.

RITTENBAND	 I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape?	BRYER	 (after a beat) We lost it. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.	RITTENBAND	 Hmmm...

RITTENBAND (CONT'D)	 I know who you're after. I saw all the evidence, not just the toll photo. You gotta get him the right way.	BRYER	 Oh, okay. (approaches the judge) So let me get this straight: What you're telling me is I'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing LOUD enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore?	RITTENBAND		(BEAT)	 Get the fuck outta of my office.	Arbitrage 
JIMMY	 Robert, look: you asked me to come meet you and I'm here, but I came because I wanted to get something straight between us: we're even.	ROBERT	 Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did... (picks up the trust document) Was way beyond the money.	JIMMY		(LAUGHS)	 Nothing's beyond money for you.	Arbitrage 
(LAUGHS BACK)	 Thanks a lot.	JIMMY	 (pointing to the document) And if I take this, then what does that say about me? He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in his pocket.	JIMMY (CONT'D)	 Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money and do something good with it. Hold on Jimmy.			Arbitrage

The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them?	Arbitrage 
ROBERT	 Apparently not, no. No.	ELLEN	 (like talking to a child) Okay, uhm, the police have been trying to talk me. I assume they want to know where you were that night. And you know what? I'm not gonna lie for you anymore. Not unless you sign that. A beat.	ROBERT	 Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.	ELLEN	 I think you'll find a way to manage.
