OLD SALIERI	 Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your assassin! Piet! Piet! Forgive your assassin! Forgive me! Forgive! Forgive!	VALET	 (looking up to the window) That's all right, Signore! He heard you! He forgave you! He wants you to go inside now and shut the window!	VALET	 Come on, Signore! Look what I have for you! I can't give it to you from down here, can I?	BYSTANDER	 Who is that?	Amadeus 
OLD SALIERI	 (taking his hands off the keys) Well?	VOGLER	 I regret it is not too familiar.	OLD SALIERI	 Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?			Amadeus 
VOGLER	 All Vienna has heard that.	OLD SALIERI	 ( eagerly) And do they believe it?	VOGLER	 Is it true?	OLD SALIERI	 Do you believe it?	Amadeus 
OLD SALIERI	 He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.	VOGLER	 (almost whispering) Yes? Did you do it?	OLD SALIERI	 He was my idol! I can't remember a time when I didn't know his name! When I was only fourteen he was already famous. Even in Legnago - the tiniest town in Italy - I knew of him.			Amadeus 
MOZART	 No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!	CONSTANZE	 (working it out) Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!	MOZART	 Em iram! Em iram!	CONSTANZE	 No, I'm not playing this game.	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 Ah-ha. Kapellmeister?	BONNO	 (Italian accent) Majesty, I must agree with Herr Dirretore. Opera is an Italian art, solamente. German is - scusate - too bruta for singing, too rough.	JOSEPH	 Ah-ha. Court Composer, what do you say?	SALIERI	 I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.	JOSEPH	 You are cattivo, Court Composer. (briskly, to Von Strack) I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.	VON STRACK	 Yes, sir.	JOSEPH	 Well. There it is.	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 What a charming idea. May I see?	SALIERI	 (handing it over) It's just a trifle, of course.	JOSEPH	 May I try it?	SALIERI	 Majesty.	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 You do me too much honour, Sire.	JOSEPH	 Let's have some fun. (to the waiting Majordomo) Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.	SALIERI	 A-flat, Majesty.	JOSEPH	 Ah-ha!	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Your Majesty!	JOSEPH	 No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. (raising Mozart up) You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. (to the others) He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?	JOSEPH	 You know all these gentlemen, I'm sure.	JOSEPH	 The Baron Von Swieten.	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.	MOZART	 (bowing excitedly) Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.	JOSEPH	 And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.	SALIERI	 (taking his hand) Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.	SALIERI	 (taking his hand) Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!	MOZART	 I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?	SALIERI	 Really?	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.	MOZART	 (speaking expertly) Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!	SALIERI	 My pleasure.	JOSEPH	 Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Majesty!	JOSEPH	 (to the courtiers) Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	 Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.	VON STRACK	 Did we?	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.	VON SWIETEN	 (kindly) My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?	MOZART	 Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! (to Joseph) It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!	JOSEPH	 Well, I'm glad to hear that.	Amadeus 
VON SWIETEN	 (kindly) My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?	MOZART	 Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! (to Joseph) It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!	JOSEPH	 Well, I'm glad to hear that.	SALIERI	 Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 Show me.	MOZART	 (to Salieri) The rest is just the same, isn't it?	MOZART	 That really doesn't work, does it?	MOZART	 Did you try this? Wouldn't it be just a little more -?	Amadeus 
CAVALIERI	 (curtseying to him) Maestro.	SALIERI	 Good morning.	CAVALIERI	 (posing, in her turban) Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!			Amadeus 
SALIERI	 Good morning.	CAVALIERI	 (posing, in her turban) Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!	SALIERI	 Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.	CAVALIERI	 Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.	CAVALIERI	 (airily) Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.					Amadeus 
OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	 There she was. I had no idea where they met - or how - yet there she stood on stage for all to see. Showing off like the greedy songbird she was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales and arpeggios, whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.	CAVALIERI	 (singing) Be freed at last by death! Be freed at last by death! At last I shall be freed By! Death!					Amadeus 
CAVALIERI	 Majesty.	JOSEPH	 (to Salieri) And to you, Court Composer. Your pupil has done you great credit.					Amadeus 
FLUNKY	 I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.	MADAME WEBER	 Do you know who I am? (pointing to Constanze) This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!	FLUNKY	 I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.	MADAME WEBER	 Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!	Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 Mother, please!	MADAME WEBER	 Go ahead, Constanze. Just ignore this fellow. (pushing her) Go ahead, dear!	FLUNKY	 (barring the way) I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.	MADAME WEBER	 Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!	Amadeus 
MADAME WEBER	 Go ahead, Constanze. Just ignore this fellow. (pushing her) Go ahead, dear!	FLUNKY	 (barring the way) I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.	MADAME WEBER	 Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!			Amadeus 
MOZART	 What do you mean, Sire?	JOSEPH	 Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? (he stops in difficulty; to Orsini- Rosenberg) How shall one say, Director?	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	 Too many notes, Your Majesty?	JOSEPH	 Exactly. Very well put. Too many notes.	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.	MOZART	 (to Salieri) But this is absurd!	JOSEPH	 My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.	MOZART	 Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 Well. There it is. Strack.	CONSTANZE	 (to Mozart) Get some water!					Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 Are you all right?	MADAME WEBER	 Ah, what an evening! What a wise man we have for an Emperor. Oh, my children! (with sudden, hard briskness) Now I want you to write your father exactly what His Majesty said.	MOZART	 You should really go home now, Frau Weber. Your carriage must be waiting.	MADAME WEBER	 But aren't you taking us?	Amadeus 
JOSEPH	 You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.	SALIERI	 (bowing) Sire.	JOSEPH	 Well. There it is.			Amadeus 
VON STRACK	 Mozart -	MOZART	 They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! (singing angrily) Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.	VON STRACK	 Mozart -	MOZART	 Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!	Amadeus 
SERVANT	 She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.	SALIERI	 (to the pupil) Excuse me, my dear.					Amadeus 
OLD SALIERI	 Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.	VOGLER	 (crying out) You cannot say that!	OLD SALIERI	 No? Was Mozart a good man?	VOGLER	 God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.	Amadeus 
VOGLER	 I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.	OLD SALIERI	 (impatiently) Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! (intimately to the priest) There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.					Amadeus 
MOZART	 Sssh!	SCHIKANEDER	 (imitating Mozart) Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!	MOZART	 Sssh! Stay here.	SCHIKANEDER	 (to the girls, very tipsy) Sssh! You're dishgrashful!	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Sssh! Stay here.	SCHIKANEDER	 (to the girls, very tipsy) Sssh! You're dishgrashful!					Amadeus 
SCHLUMBERG	 Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you. (to Mozart) Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.	MOZART	 And which one of them do you want me to teach?	SCHLUMBERG	 What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow. (shouting) Hannah! Come this way.			Amadeus 
MOZART	 And which one of them do you want me to teach?	SCHLUMBERG	 What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow. (shouting) Hannah! Come this way.	SCHLUMBERG	 Hannah!	SCHLUMBERG	 (to Mozart) You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.	Amadeus 
SCHLUMBERG	 (to Mozart) You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.	MOZART	 (bowing) Madame.	SCHLUMBERG	 This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 Upstairs.	Amadeus 
SCHLUMBERG	 Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 (to Mozart) Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?	MOZART	 I'd like a little wine, if you have it.	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 Wine?	Amadeus 
FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 Wine?	SCHLUMBERG	 Quite right. He's going to need it. (calling and clapping his hands) Klaus! A bottle of wine. Prestissimo! Now let's go to it. I've been waiting all day for this.					Amadeus 
MOZART	 Now, please play me something. Just to give me an idea. Anything will do.	GERTRUDE	 (to parents) I don't want you to stay.	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 That's all right, dear. Just go ahead, as if we weren't here.	GERTRUDE	 But you are here.	Amadeus 
SCHLUMBERG	 Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?	MOZART	 Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. (to Gertrude) How long have you been playing, Fraulein?	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 Just one year.	MOZART	 Who was your teacher?	Amadeus 
FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.	MOZART	 Thank you, Madame. (to Gertrude) Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.	MOZART	 Perhaps it would be better if we were left alone. I think we're both a little shy.	SCHLUMBERG	 Nonsense. Strudel's not shy. She's just willful! You give into her now, you'll be sorry later. Strudel - play.	Amadeus 
FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 Michael!	MOZART	 Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein. (to the girl) Why don't you let me try the instrument? All right?	SCHLUMBERG	 Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at once! (to Mozart) Don't let him disturb you. He'll be all right. He's just a little willful too. Please, please - play. I beg you.	SCHLUMBERG	 Stop it! STOP!	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Perhaps if I were to play a little first, it might encourage the Fraulein. (to the girl) Why don't you let me try the instrument? All right?	SCHLUMBERG	 Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at once! (to Mozart) Don't let him disturb you. He'll be all right. He's just a little willful too. Please, please - play. I beg you.	SCHLUMBERG	 Stop it! STOP!	SCHLUMBERG	 No, not you. I was talking to the dog. You keep playing. It's most important. He always howls when he hears music. We've got to break them of the habit. Play, please. Please!	Amadeus 
SCHLUMBERG	 It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!	MOZART	 (barely controlling himself) Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!	FRAU SCHLUMBERG	 What a strange young man.	SCHLUMBERG	 Yes. He is a little strange.	Amadeus 
LEOPOLD	 No, really!	MOZART	 (calling to him) This is just a game, Papa.	CONSTANZE	 This is just a game, Papa!	BYSTANDERS	 This is just a game, Papa!	Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 (outside the door) Wolfi! Wolfgang!	MOZART	 What is it?	CONSTANZE	 There's a young girl to see you.			Amadeus 
MOZART	 Are you playing a trick on me?	LEOPOLD	 I never saw this girl in my life. (to Lorl) Is this a kind of joke?	LORL	 Not at all, sir. And I was told to wait for an answer.	LEOPOLD	 Young woman, this won't do at all. My son can't possibly accept such an offer, no matter how generous, unless he knows who is behind it.	Amadeus 
LEOPOLD	 But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!	CONSTANZE	 Well, this is none of your business. (to Lorl) Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?	LORL	 That's right, ma'am.	LEOPOLD	 So now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house?	Amadeus 
LEOPOLD	 So now we are going to let a perfect stranger into the house?	CONSTANZE	 Who is we? Who is letting who? (to Lorl) Could you please wait outside?	LORL	 Yes, ma'am.	CONSTANZE	 Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -	Amadeus 
LEOPOLD	 So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.	CONSTANZE	 (to Mozart) Do you hear him? Do you?	CONSTANZE	 (to Lorl) When can you start?	LORL	 Right away, ma'am.	Amadeus 
LORL	 Right away, ma'am.	CONSTANZE	 Good! Come in. You'll start with that room there. (indicating Leopold's room) It's filthy!	LEOPOLD	 Sorry, sorry! I'm sorry I spoke! I'm just a provincial from Salzburg. What do I know about smart Vienna? Parties all night, every night. Dancing and drinking like idiot children!			Amadeus 
LEOPOLD	 Your Majesty.	JOSEPH	 Good evening. (to Leopold) We have met before, Herr Mozart.	LEOPOLD	 That's right, Your Majesty. Twenty years ago. No, twenty-two! twenty- three! And I remember word for word what you said to me. You said - you said --	JOSEPH	 Bravo?	Amadeus 
MOZART	 But, Your Majesty -	JOSEPH	 (motioning him to be silent) Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.	MOZART	 Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.	JOSEPH	 I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.	Amadeus 
VON SWIETEN	 Mozart -	MOZART	 (ignoring him) Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?	VON SWIETEN	 Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?	MOZART	 Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?	VON SWIETEN	 (aroused) Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.	BONNO	 Bello! Bello, Barone. Veramente.	MOZART	 Oh, bello, bello, bello! Come on now, be honest. Wouldn't you all rather listen to your hairdressers than Hercules? Or Horatius? Or Orpheus? All those old bores! people so lofty they sound as if they shit marble!	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Thank you! Oh, thank you.	SALIERI	 (withdrawing it; imitating the Emperor) No, no, no, Herr Mozart, please. It's not a holy relic.					Amadeus 
MOZART	 Ladies and gentlemen, we're going from where we stopped. The Count: Anches so. Right away, please!	JOSEPH	 (to Orsini-Rosenberg) What I hoped by that edict, Director, was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in French opera. There it is endless, as you know.	ORSINI-ROSENBERG	 Quite so, Majesty.			Amadeus 
MOZART	 I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.	SALIERI	 (fuming) I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.	MOZART	 Oh no, the honour would be all mine.	SALIERI	 (bowing) Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Oh no, the honour would be all mine.	SALIERI	 (bowing) Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!	MOZART	 Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!			Amadeus 
MOZART	 (to Schikaneder) Well?	SCHIKANEDER	 (mock moved) Sublime! Utterly sublime!	MOZART	 That kind of music should be punishable by death.			Amadeus 
MOZART	 We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? (to a girl) This is! a very nice girl.	CONSTANZE	 (standing up) Wolfi.	MOZART	 Yes, my love?	CONSTANZE	 These gentlemen are from Salzburg.	Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 These gentlemen are from Salzburg.	MOZART	 Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg. (to the two men, jubilantly) If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!	CONSTANZE	 Wolfi! Your father is dead.	MOZART	 What?	Amadeus 
THE COMMENDATORE	 (singing) Don Giovanni!	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	 So rose the dreadful ghost in his next and blackest opera. There on the stage stood the figure of a dead commander calling out 'Repent! Repent!'	OLD SALIERI (V.O.)	 And I knew - only I understood - that the horrifying apparition was Leopold, raised from the dead. Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world. It was terrifying and wonderful to watch.			Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 C-c-c-come in!	COMMENDATORE	 (singing) Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!	COMMENDATORE	 Down! Down!	COMMENDATORE	 I'm here! I'm here!	Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 Who the devil are you? What do you want?	COMMENDATORE	 (singing) I've come to dinnnnnner!	SCHIKANEDER	 Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.	COMMENDATORE	 Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!	Amadeus

DWARVES	 (all together) Five hours, five minutes, five seconds.	COMMENDATORE	 (speaking) I can't wait that long. I'm starving!	OTTAVIO	 (speaking; four voices) So am I.	SCHIKANEDER	 (singing to the tune of Non piu ante) In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!	Amadeus

COMMENDATORE	 Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.	THE THREE GIRLS	 (singing again to the horse) Give me your hoof, my darling, and I'll give you my heart.	COMMENDATORE	 Shut up. I'm sick of that one too.	COMMENDATORE	 And that one, too!	Amadeus 
COMMENDATORE	 And that one, too!	SOPRANO	 (singing) Oil me! Broil me! Boil me!	SOPRANO	 (from inside the pot) Soil me! Foil me! Spoil me!	HORSE	 I can't eat her. Sopranos give me hiccups. I want some hay!	Amadeus 
HORSE	 I can't eat her. Sopranos give me hiccups. I want some hay!	FIRST LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	SECOND LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	THIRD LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	Amadeus 
FIRST LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	SECOND LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	THIRD LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	SCHIKANEDER	 Hey what?	Amadeus 
SECOND LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	THIRD LADY	 (singing to Schikaneder) Hey!	SCHIKANEDER	 Hey what?	ALL THREE LADIES	 (singing to La oi daram) Give him some hay, my darling, and I'll give you my heart!	Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 Hey what?	ALL THREE LADIES	 (singing to La oi daram) Give him some hay, my darling, and I'll give you my heart!	COMMENDATORE	 Shut up.	SCHIKANEDER	 Leporello! We want some hay - prestissimo! Leporello - where are you?	Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 Leporello! We want some hay - prestissimo! Leporello - where are you?	FIRST LADY	 (singing to horse) Behold!	SECOND LADY	 (singing to horse) Behold!	THIRD LADY	 (singing to horse) Behold!	Amadeus

SECOND LADY	 (singing to horse) Behold!	THIRD LADY	 (singing to horse) Behold!	COMMENDATORE	 (holding on) Hey! Hey! Watch out!	COMMENDATORE	 Whoa! Whoa, Ottavio! Whoa!	Amadeus 
THIRD LADY	 (singing to horse) Behold!	COMMENDATORE	 (holding on) Hey! Hey! Watch out!	COMMENDATORE	 Whoa! Whoa, Ottavio! Whoa!	SCHIKANEDER	 Well, how do you like that?	Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 Well, how do you like that?	MOZART	 Wonderful! (indicating his baby son) He liked the monkey, didn't you?	SCHIKANEDER	 Yes, well, it's all good fun.	MOZART	 I liked the horse.	Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 How much will you pay him?	SCHIKANEDER	 Ah. Well. Ah, (to Mozart) I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?	MOZART	 Half the receipts! Stanzi!	CONSTANZE	 I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?	Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.	MOZART	 (to Karl) Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.	CONSTANZE	 Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.	MOZART	 (dirty) Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!	Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.	MOZART	 (dirty) Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!	CONSTANZE	 Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.			Amadeus 
VON SWIETEN	 (keeping his voice down) This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.	SALIERI	 I agree, Baron.	VON SWIETEN	 Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?			Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 Not at all.	SCHIKANEDER	 (peering into he room) Where's our friend?	CONSTANZE	 He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.	SCHIKANEDER	 I hope so. I need it immediately.	Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.	CONSTANZE	 Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. (shouting) Who are you?	SCHIKANEDER	 Listen, Wolfi. Write it. Please. Just write it down. On paper. It's no good to anyone in your head. And fuck the Death Mass.			Amadeus 
LORL	 I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.	SALIERI	 (startled) Opera? Opera!	LORL	 Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	SALIERI	 (insistently) Are you sure it's an opera?	Amadeus 
LORL	 Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.	SALIERI	 (insistently) Are you sure it's an opera?					Amadeus 
VOICE	 Go back!	PAPAGENO	 Merciful Gods! If only I knew by which door I came in. (to audience) Which was it? Was it this one? Come on, tell me!	VOICE	 Go back!	PAPAGENO	 Now, I can't go forward and I can't go back. Oh, this is awful!	Amadeus 
PAPAGENO	 Now, I can't go forward and I can't go back. Oh, this is awful!	FIRST PRIEST	 (on stage) Man, thou hast deserved to wander forever in the darkest chasms of the earth. The gentle Gods have remitted thy punishment, but yet thou shalt never feel the Divine Content of the consecrated ones.	PAPAGENO	 Oh well, I'm not alone in that. Just give me a decent glass of wine - that's divine content enough for me.	FIRST PRIEST	 Man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink?	Amadeus 
FIRST PRIEST	 Man, hast thou no other desire on earth, but just to eat and drink?	PAPAGENO	 (Schikaneder) Well!	PAPAGENO	 Well, actually I do have a rather weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps it's just indigestion. But you know, I really would like - I really do want - something even nicer than food and drink. Now what on earth could that be?	ANDANTE	 A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!	Amadeus 
ALLEGRO	 Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!	ANDANTE	 (encore, lightly, as before) A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.	ALLEGRO	 I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!	ANDANTE	 (encore) A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.	Amadeus 
ALLEGRO	 I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.

ANDANTE	 (encore) A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.	ALLEGRO	 At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!			Amadeus 
UGLY OLD WOMAN	 Here I am, my angel.	PAPAGENO	 (appalled) What? Who the devil are you?	UGLY OLD WOMAN	 I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.	PAPAGENO	 Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.	Amadeus 
UGLY OLD WOMAN	 Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.	PAPAGENO	 (nervous) I can't wait.	UGLY OLD WOMAN	 Well, promise then.	PAPAGENO	 What do you mean - now?	Amadeus 
PAPAGENO	 Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?	UGLY OLD WOMAN	 (amorously) Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.					Amadeus 
SALIERI	 (handing the porter the lantern) Thank you. Go.	MOZART	 (vaguely singing) Papa! Papa!	SALIERI	 Come now.	SALIERI	 Where is your wife?	Amadeus 
SCHIKANEDER	 I'll call tomorrow.	SALIERI	 Yes. (to the actresses) And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.	ACTRESSES	 Thank you! Thank you, Excellency!	SCHIKANEDER	 Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!	ACTRESSES	 (delighted) Goodnight, Your Excellency. Goodnight!					Amadeus 
CONSTANZE	 I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.	OFFICER	 (laying a hand on her arm) What are you talking about?					Amadeus 
MOZART	 Where did I stop?	SALIERI	 (consulting the manuscript) The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.	MOZART	 So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?	SALIERI	 Consigned to flames of woe.	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. (singing the note) Con-fu-ta-tis. (speaking) Second measure, second beat. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis. (speaking) G-sharp, of course.	SALIERI	 Yes.	MOZART	 Third measure, second beat starting on E. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. (speaking) And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. (singing) Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. (speaking) Do you have that?			Amadeus 
SALIERI	 Yes.	MOZART	 Fourth measure, second beat - F. (singing) Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.	MOZART	 Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. (He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone -	SALIERI	 (labouring to keep up) Please! Just one moment.	Amadeus 
MOZART	 Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. (He hurriedly hums the opening notes of the bass vocal line) The first bassoon and tenor trombone -	SALIERI	 (labouring to keep up) Please! Just one moment.	MOZART	 It couldn't be simpler.	SALIERI	 (finishing) First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?	Amadeus 
MOZART	 It couldn't be simpler.	SALIERI	 (finishing) First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?	MOZART	 With the tenors.	SALIERI	 Also identical?	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 And that's all?	MOZART	 Oh no. Now for the Fire. (he smiles) Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.	MOZART	 (speaking) Second measure on B.	MOZART	 (speaking) Do you have me?	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 You go fast!	MOZART	 (urgently) Do you have it?	SALIERI	 Yes.	MOZART	 Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!	Amadeus 
SALIERI	 Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.	CONSTANZE	 Wolfi? (louder) Wolfi?					Amadeus 
OLD SALIERI	 Being bowed to and saluted, called 'distinguished - distinguished Salieri' - by men incapable of distinguishing! Thirty-two years of meaningless fame to end up alone in my room, watching myself become extinct. My music growing fainter, all the time fainter, until no one plays it at all. And his growing louder, filling the world with wonder. And everyone who loves my sacred art crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.	ATTENDANT	 Good morning, Professor! Time for the water closet. And then we've got your favourite breakfast for you - sugar-rolls. (to Vogler) He loves those. Fresh sugar-rolls.	OLD SALIERI	 Goodbye, Father. I'll speak for you. I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint. On their behalf I deny Him, your God of no mercy. Your God who tortures men with longings they can never fulfill. He may forgive me: I shall never forgive Him.			Amadeus
