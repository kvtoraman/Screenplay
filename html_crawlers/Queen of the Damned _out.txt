LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST	 Why not a demo at your own house? I mean, what's with all the secrecy about where you stay? Is it true you move residences every few days?	LESTAT	 (smiles, giving away nothing) After calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long, I like to experience as much diversity as I can. Wouldn't you?	MUSIC JOURNALIST	 There are a lot of rumors flying around the internet about the hidden meaning in your lyrics, that you're giving away 'vampire secrets.' Something in all that?	20   SMALL TV SCREEN                                              20		Queen of the Damned

MUSIC JOURNALIST	 Your first and only concert's in Death Valley, just days away. Why just the one?	LESTAT	 (grins) I don't like repeating myself.	MUSIC JOURNALIST	 But these other vampires, aren't they going to be pissed that you're giving away their secrets?	LESTAT	 I imagine they are, yes.	Queen of the Damned

TALAMASCAN #1	 I don't know, Jesse. It looks to me like the guy's got a good P.R. man with a flair for the theatrical.	JESSE	 (leans forward, eagerly) It would appear that way. But have you listened to his songs? Read his lyrics?	40   CONTINUED:                                                   40		JESSE	 Well,i have. In one of his songs he refers to a pub called the Sailor's Arms. I think it's a clue...	Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 It's a vampire coven. And Lestat's leading us to it.	TALAMASCAN #1	 (skeptical) And what makes you think so?	TALAMASCAN #2	 Jesse, can you, uh, focus that any better?	40   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               40		Queen of the Damned

JESSE	 (quickly, trying to cover) But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. I'm sure of it. And Lestat's leading us to them and --	TALAMASCAN #3	 (interrupting) Interesting.

(quickly) Look, I know it was breaking protocol and I'm really sorry, it's just I think --	TALAMASCAN #1	 Jesse! You're just an apprentice here! You must follow our rules... Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position.	TALAMASCAN #3	 For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior. But never get involved. You're getting far too close.	Queen of the Damned

JESSE	 (gesturing to photo, defending herself) Hey, does it look like I got involved? That is not called involvement. That is called running.

Queen of the Damned 
TALAMASCAN #1	 It doesn't make any sense. Why would he be forecasting this to the world? He's all but drawn a map and marked an X. What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. They'd be hunted down.	JESSE	 Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know why... (glancing at skeptical Talamascan #1) But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution.	40   CONTINUED:    (6)                                                40		TALAMASCAN #1	 And this photo is your evidence? It's hardly conclusive. (snorts) C'mon.

MARIUS	 Shhh. The life of a vampire is a life of discretion. We must sleep during the day, when we are vulnerable to the sun. Mortals must never know about us. It is forbidden, for the sake of all our kind.	LESTAT	 (gazing at violin player as it sinks in) So I could never know her?	MARIUS	 Not unless you wanted to kill her.

And in her wrath, she will devour everything that moves. Mortal and vampire alike.	LESTAT	 (smiles at Marius, softly) Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.	LESTAT	 Do you remember your first words to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.' (shakes his head) I'd rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost.	MARIUS	 And you're taking everyone with you, you fool! We were once mortals, too. It is our heritage we protect!	Queen of the Damned 
MARIUS	 And you're taking everyone with you, you fool! We were once mortals, too. It is our heritage we protect!	LESTAT	 (moving away) Such reverence for mortals! Then you should have left me as one!	MARIUS	 You're a monster.	LESTAT	 (shakes his head with a dark laugh) Said the vampire to his son.	Queen of the Damned 
MARIUS	 You're a monster.	LESTAT	 (shakes his head with a dark laugh) Said the vampire to his son.					Queen of the Damned 
VAMPIRE LOVER	 You like him, love?	AKASHA	 (still staring at TV) He reminds me of someone I know.	VAMPIRE LOVER	 All he's gonna remind you of soon is a pile of bones. We're gonna dismember him. Bleed him dry.	AKASHA	 Really? Is that what you're going to do?	Queen of the Damned 
KHAYMAN	 You have been summoned because of your errant child...	PANDORA	 (giving deep, sexy laugh) He's quite the devil, isn't he?	ARMAND	 His music mocks us, Pandora!	PANDORA	 His music moves my blood.	Queen of the Damned 
MAHARET	 Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We have greater problems...	MARIUS	 (stepping up) Maharet is right. It is Akasha we face now.	PANDORA	 (joyous) Is it true, Maharet?   Has our Queen really risen!	MAHARET	 Don't be so happy, Pandora. I knew Akasha when she walked this earth. I was her slave. I am now her enemy. I know what she is capable of.	Queen of the Damned 
MARIUS	 (stepping up) Maharet is right. It is Akasha we face now.	PANDORA	 (joyous) Is it true, Maharet?   Has our Queen really risen!	MAHARET	 Don't be so happy, Pandora.

I know what she is capable of.	126   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            126		Queen of the Damned 
126   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            126		ARMAND	 Yes. We've all felt her presence, even as she hides from us. (as others nod, acknowledging the truth of this) What does she want now?	MAHARET	 She knows only one thing. Taking pleasure in destroying life. She is already killing the young ones to build her strength.	MARIUS	 She's sucked the life out of her King like a praying mantis. I sense she is getting closer.	Queen of the Damned 
ARMAND	 But perhaps she has come to kill Lestat and then will go back to her slumber. That is our only hope.	PANDORA	 (eager) Yes. That's right. She and the covens will take care of that brat. We must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great Queen.	MAHARET	 How? With your own throat! You've all been asleep too long! You're still dreaming.	MARIUS	 Maharet speaks the truth.   It is our only hope.	Queen of the Damned 
126   CONTINUED:    (4)                                             126		MAHARET	 Then you go to the concert and you shall see! (shakes her head) And I thought the Ancients became wise with their years.					Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 Roger... would you be so kind?	ROGER	 (surprised, relieved) Sure. Right this way, girls.	LESTAT	 Roger. Not that one.   Leave her to me...	LESTAT	 You must be very keen to die.	Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 How did you find me?	JESSE	 I've been tracking your manager for days... (gesturing to her Goth outfit) Then I figured out you simply have to look the part.	LESTAT	 Clever librarian... You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again.	130   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              130		Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 Then why are you following me? What do you want?	JESSE	 (terrified, in a whisper) Are you granting wishes?	LESTAT	 (smiles, in a whisper playing    with her) Last wishes. What's yours?	JESSE	 Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat.	Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 (terrified, in a whisper) Are you granting wishes?	LESTAT	 (smiles, in a whisper playing    with her) Last wishes. What's yours?	JESSE	 Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat.	LESTAT	 (turning away) I don't have time for this.	Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat.	LESTAT	 (turning away) I don't have time for this.	JESSE	 All a vampire has is time.	LESTAT	 Maybe not.	Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 Maybe not.	JESSE	 (softly) Right. The covens are coming for you. (softly) I understand why you're doing it. You have to be who you are, no matter what happens.	130   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             130		JESSE	 But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat? As you always have... Alone.	Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 I can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. I can't live a lie... I'm just like you Lestat. We're the same...	LESTAT	 (softly) Are we? I seek the light.     You seek the shadows.	JESSE	 No. We're looking for exactly the same thing. You know it... Please. Show me.	LESTAT	 Alright!	Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 This may be painful for a mortal. You're still attached to your skin.	JESSE	 (an excited whisper) I don't care.	LESTAT	 Close your eyes.    Don't breathe.	131   LESTAT AND JESSE                                               131		Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 Did it hurt?	LESTAT	 Yes. For just a moment. But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy. (gazes at her) You see, we love our victims.	JESSE	 Love?    I thought it was the blood.	LESTAT	 No, although the taste is so rich and sweet. Love is the essence of the dark gift. The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else.	Queen of the Damned 
132   CONTINUED:                                                          132		LESTAT	 As you drink, you feel the heart weakening... it struggles even though there's no hope. You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. The taste of mortality you can no longer experience... and it is beautiful... (pulls away sharply) No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience.	LESTAT	 (groans) Your blood...	JESSE	 (murmurs) Do you like it?	Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 (groans) Your blood...	JESSE	 (murmurs) Do you like it?	132   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              132		LESTAT	 (losing himself) Yes...	Queen of the Damned

JESSE	 Oh my God, this is why... I knew I was different. I knew --	MAHARET	 (strongly) Come...	MAHARET	 You are the most precious of my great family...	JESSE	 Am I...?	Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 Am I...?	MAHARET	 (strongly) No. You are not. I was once mortal, too. My sister died before her child was one year old. I took care of that child, and her children, and her children's children...	MAHARET	 This is our family -- my way of coping with eternity. The labyrinth of life. The family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age.	144   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   144		Queen of the Damned 
MAHARET	 Jesse, you must forget about him. You must trust me...	JESSE	 (gazes up at her a long moment) I missed you so much, Aunt Maharet.	MAHARET	 Me too.	MAHARET	 You will go home to London in the morning.	Queen of the Damned 
VAMPIRE DRIVER	 Need a ride?	JESSE	 (smiles) Yeah.					Queen of the Damned

I know that you crave to have the world at your feet. I have come to give it to you.	AKASHA	 Has your tongue lost its taste for blood?	LESTAT	 (melting) Never.	Queen of the Damned 
AKASHA	 Has your tongue lost its taste for blood?	LESTAT	 (melting) Never.	AKASHA	 But you didn't kill the mortal girl.	AKASHA	 Instead you kissed her.   Now kiss me. (NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him, hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as...	Queen of the Damned 
MAHARET	 We see now what Akasha means to do. Rule as Queen again. (pointing to the great family) This is why we must fight Akasha!	182   CONTINUED:                                                   182		MAHARET	 For the sake of all mortals.

AKASHA	 They believed in nothing, now they are nothing. But you and I will change all that. We will give the world something to believe in again.	Queen of the Damned 
MARIUS	 Akasha, please...	AKASHA	 (venomous) You think you can change my will? I'm tired of this discussion. Join me, or die.	MAHARET	 I will not.	MARIUS	 I will not.	Queen of the Damned 
LESTAT	 She's nothing to me.	AKASHA	 Just the same, I'd like you to kill her. For me. (to the Ancients) I've had enough of this 'great family.' It's time to end it.	MAHARET	 You will not touch her!	AKASHA	 You still think to challenge me, Maharet?	Queen of the Damned 
JESSE	 It's what I want.   I am ready.	AKASHA	 (smirking) How sweet...	193   CONTINUED:    (4)                                                193		AKASHA	 Good-bye, great family.	Queen of the Damned

MAHARET	 My child, let me look at you... You are finally happy. It is as it should be now... I will watch over you always.	ARMAND	 (a reverent whisper) She took Akasha's last drop, took Akasha's death into herself. Behold, our Queen... our new mother...	JESSE	 Is she... dead?	KHAYMAN	 No, she will live forever. She sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of us.	Queen of the Damned 
TALBOT	 Jesse.     My God...	JESSE	 (smiles) David, this is Lestat.	TALBOT	 How do you do?	LESTAT	 Charmed, I'm sure.	Queen of the Damned
