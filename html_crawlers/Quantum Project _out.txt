PENTCHO	 Probability of this happening, same make, model, color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of God.	WILL	 (seething) Sorry I asked. (beat) You got insurance?					Quantum Project 
PENTCHO	 Is that your...	MIA	 No. (beat) Not yet.	PENTCHO	 Could we go somewhere?	MIA	 I'm heading out of town.	Quantum Project 
MIA	 I'm heading out of town.	PENTCHO	 (deep breath) Okay.	MIA	 What?	PENTCHO	 I could go out of town.	Quantum Project 
MIA	 Could you?	PENTCHO	 (nodding) Where to?	MIA	 A place you've never been.	PENTCHO	 That's the physicist's playground.	Quantum Project 
PENTCHO	 Could be.	MIA	 (wryly) What universe are you in, Paul?	PENTCHO	 A quantum one.			Quantum Project 
MIA	 I always said we were in the same business...	PENTCHO	 If you're right, we have a chance. (beat) To be together.	WHOOSH!		VOICE (OC)	 I'm not done.	Quantum Project 
MIA (CONT'D)	 "Things fall apart; the center will not hold.  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."	PENTCHO	 An electron spoke to me yesterday.  (beat) I swear.	MIA	 What did it want?	PENTCHO	 That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.	Quantum Project 
PENTCHO (CONT'D)	 Did you know electrons have lovers?	MIA	 No.  I didn't.  (dryly) I'm listening.	PENTCHO	 Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...	PENTCHO (CONT'D)	 A strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like...	Quantum Project 
MIA	 She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --	PENTCHO	 (plowing ahead) A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --	MIA	 Dysfunctional --	PENTCHO	 That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --	Quantum Project 
PENTCHO	 You taking any medication?	ALEXANDER	 Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me (pulling the gun out) to this particular switching station?	PENTCHO	 Dad...	ALEXANDER	 Two: what if I didn't miss?	Quantum Project 
PENTCHO	 You did miss --	ALEXANDER	 -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?  (softer) What did your life mean? (beat) Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?	ALEXANDER (CONT'D)	 What was her name?	PENTCHO	 Excuse me???	Quantum Project 
ALEXANDER (CONT'D)	 The restorer...	PENTCHO	 I need some air. (beat) Don't shoot me.	ALEXANDER'S VOICE (OC)	 Good night.			Quantum Project 
ON PENTCHO: EXTREME CLOSE UP		PENTCHO	 Yes.  (beat) Yes I can.					Quantum Project 
MIA	 I've been dreaming about this.	PENTCHO	 (excited) Then you get it.  You'll understand.	MIA	 What?	PENTCHO	 I know what I want.  I let go, and a second later you materialized at the door.  You see?	Quantum Project 
PENTCHO (CONT'D)	 Mia.  I can create reality.  (beat) I can choose to love you with all my heart.	MIA	 You know those people who won't be photographed because they're afraid you're stealing their souls...? (long beat) I came to take back my picture.  The one I keep leaving with you.	PENTCHO	 Why?	MIA	 So I can move on.  You too.	Quantum Project
