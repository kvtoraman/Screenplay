PILOT	 No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even be flying in this shit.	COFFEY	 (cool) Just hold it over the deck.	COFFEY	 You want to be on that ship, there's only one way it's going to happen.			Abyss,-The
COFFEY	 You want to be on that ship, there's only one way it's going to happen. CUT TO: MCBRIDE (on screen) Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be making our lives real interesting in a few hours.	BUD	 Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be named after women.					Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 I can't believe you let them do this!	BUD	 (unpreturbed, almost cheerful) Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.	LINDSEY	 I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?	BUD	 Wasn't up to me.	Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 Take her up, Byron!	KIRKHILL	 What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a bitch... (into microphone) Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking her down.	LINDSEY	 Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in this thing than he does. (to Coffey) A little change of plan.	COFFEY	 Lady, we better fish or cut bait.	Abyss,-The

MCBRIDE	 Cab Three, you are clear to launch.	LINDSEY	 Roger. (to Coffey) There's only one way it's going to happen...	LINDSEY	 Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer... Cab Three.  We are styling. MCBRIDE (filtered) Roger, Cab Three.	BUD/HIPPY	 ... I've been driving every kinda rig that's ever been maaaaade...	Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...	MONK	 (as if by rote) High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.	LINDSEY	 Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.	COFFEY	 Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.	Abyss,-The
COFFEY	 Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.	LINDSEY	 Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good. (Coffey turn away) Well, hey... you guys know any songs?	CATFISH	 Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.	HIPPY	 Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.	Abyss,-The
JAMMER	 Howdy, there, little lady.	COFFEY	 (to Jammer) Show us the dive prep area.  We need to check out your gear.	LINDSEY	 Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.			Abyss,-The
BUD	 You never did like being called that, did you?	LINDSEY	 Not even when it meant something. (looking through the front port) Is that One Night up in Flatbed?	BUD	 Who else?	LINSEY	 Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.	Abyss,-The
HIPPY	 No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth shit.  I'll go.  Shit!	COFFEY	 (to all) On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me, and you will follow my instructions without discussion.  Is this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.	BUD	 Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.	COFFEY	 I can't afford slack, Brigman.	Abyss,-The
HIPPY	 How deep?	MONK	 Deep. (shrugs) It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.	CATFISH	 You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?	MONK	 Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.	Abyss,-The
MONK (V.O.)	 Stand by on the ROV.	HIPPY	 Perry, stand by on the ROV. (to Little Geek) Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?	MONK	 It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up.	COFFEY (V.O.)	 Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.	Abyss,-The
MONK	 I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching holes.  This type of thing... there's not much I can do.  The coma could last hours or days. CUT TO: DEMARCO (video) Did any of you see it?	COFFEY	 Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it.	DEMARCO	 CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked within fifty miles of here... and now we don't know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase Two.			Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 Bud, this is big time. CUT TO: WILHITE (filtered) Separation sequencer disconnected.  Next? MONK (filtered) Remove explosive bolts one through six in counterclock-wise sequence. SCHOENICK (filtered) Check... removing bolt one.	NEWSCASTER (V.O.)	 ... just learned that Soviet negotiators have walked out of the strategic arms limitation summit in protest over the incident this morning.	ANOTHER NEWSCASTER	 ... US and NATO military forces have been put on full alert worldwide this morning in the wake of...			Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.	BUD	 Hey, Lins... (she looks up) I'm glad your here.	LINDSEY	 Yeah?  Well I'm not.			Abyss,-The
HIPPY	 That's Perry.	BUD	 (lets his breath out slowly) That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.	HIPPY	 (gestured at the screen) Do we just leave him there?	BUD	 Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.	Abyss,-The

CATFISH	 You watch yourself. ONE NIGHT Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension. (he hands it to her) So there you were--	BUD	 There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.					Abyss,-The
COFFEY	 I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.	LINDSEY	 (rolling her eyes) Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.	COFFEY	 (to One Night) Why haven't you finished repairs on the hydrophone transmitter yet?			Abyss,-The

LINDSEY	 You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?	COFFEY	 Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you. (to Schoenick) Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.	LINDSEY	 Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!	BUD	 Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!	Abyss,-The
CATFISH	 What's the problem?	BUD	 Nothing.  We were just leaving. (to her) Weren't we?	COFFEY	 They can't be trusted.  They're turning against us.  We may have to take... steps.	BUD	 Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.	Abyss,-The
HIPPY	 All set, big guy.  Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face.	BUD	 (whispering) I think it likes you.	LINDSEY	 It's trying to communicate.	LINDSEY	 Seawater.	Abyss,-The
HIPPY	 They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them.	LINDSEY	 Oh my God...  Oh no... (steps toward Coffey) Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what you're doing... for God's sake--	SCHOENICK		GET BACK!		Abyss,-The
BUD	 We have to stop him!  Schoenick!!	LINDSEY	 ... he's about to declare war on an alien species, Schoenick, just when they're trying to make contact with us. (to Bud) I think I'm reaching him.	LINDSEY	 See?	MONK	 I'm the least of your problems.	Abyss,-The
BUD	 Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?	CATFISH	 Wish us luck. (hands his wallet to Hippy) 'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go, podner, I ain't got all day.	BUD	 Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.	CATFISH	 I can't... make it... podner.	Abyss,-The
CATFISH	 Hey!	BUD	 (to Catfish) Get the door!	CATFISH		SHOOT!		Abyss,-The
BUD	 Helmet... helmet!  Work fast. ONE NIGHT I'll unhook. (Lindsey hesitates) GO!  You're better in these than I am.	LINDSEY (V.O.)	 Get in!	LINDSEY	 You owe me one, Virgil.			Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 Well, that's that.	BUD	 Wonderful. (looking around) There's some light from somewhere...	LINDSEY	 Over there.  It's the rig.	BUD	 Good hundred yards, I'd say.	Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.	BUD	 Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this... (the rate of flooding) Time I get back you'll be--	BUD	 Alright, put this on.	LINDSEY	 What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.	Abyss,-The
BUD	 Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?	CATFISH	 (gently) Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.	BUD	 No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong, she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do it... DO IT!	BUD	 Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you never backed down from anything in life... now fight!	Abyss,-The
LINDSEY	 No, Bud, no... not you.	BUD	 Who then? BUD (muffled) So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?	MONK	 The fluid prevents your larynx from making sound.  It'll feel a little strange. BUD (muffled) Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist. (a beat) The moment of truth, huh?	BUD	 Okay.  Let's rock and roll.	Abyss,-The

Just keep breathing as it fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let yourself take it in.	Abyss,-The
MONK	 Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body will remember.	LINDSEY	 Can you hear me okay? (another thumbs up) Try your keypad.	LINDSEY	 I already have, moron.	HIPPY	 I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek! He should take you right to it.  All you gotta do is hang on!	Abyss,-The
DEMARCO	 Where?	BENDIX	 Where?  EVERYWHERE!! (looks out the window) Over there!  Port bow.	BENDIX	 Look...	LINDSEY	 We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.	Abyss,-The
