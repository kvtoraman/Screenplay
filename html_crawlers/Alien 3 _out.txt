JOHN	 He likes when I read to him and -- I can't --	ABBOT	 (smiles) Someone must have left this one unlocked. Take the book with you.	JOHN	 Father, I --?	ABBOT	 Kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today.	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 Just have it back before the end of lunch. Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.	JOHN	 Thank you. (to Mattias) Let's go upstairs, boy.					Alien 3 
COMPUTER VOICE	 (sotto) Seal broken...seal broken...	WOMAN	 ...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead. Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed. Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...	KYLE	 John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?			Alien 3 
FIRST MONK	 (reverent) A space ship...	SECOND MONK	 (even more reverent) A woman...	KYLE	 You shouldn't have gone in --	JOHN	 I'm supposed to be a doctor.	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Ripley.  How did I get here?	ABBOT	 Your vehicle crash landed. (indicates John) Brother John found you and brought you here.	RIPLEY	 Where is here?	ABBOT	 This is the Minorite Abbey within the manmade orbiter Arceon.	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 You were the only living thing found aboard that vessel.	RIPLEY	 (slowly) Oh, God.  Newt.	RIPLEY	 It came with us.	ABBOT	 What came with you?	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 Almost two days --	RIPLEY	 (calculates) Loose for two days.  This planet could be overrun within the week.	RIPLEY	 Look, there's a xenomorph -- (sees his confusion) An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster. And now it's here.	RIPLEY	 Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six months ago - maybe a year --	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six months ago - maybe a year --	ABBOT	 (interrupts) Wait a moment --	ABBOT	 Leave us.	ABBOT	 Continue.	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 When we left Earth seventy years ago, it was on the brink of a New Dark Age. Technology was on the verge of destroying the planet's environment.  A computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any way it could be averted.  In the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse. Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the Earth no longer existed.	RIPLEY	 (slowly) Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How many people do you have here?  Let's worry about them.  Warn them --	ABBOT	 Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest some more.	RIPLEY	 I don't need rest - I need to get to your people.  You've got to get to them -- tell them about the alien --	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 I was on the Earth less than a year ago. It's still there.  People, cities, all still there!	ABBOT	 (matter of fact) All dead.	RIPLEY	 (screams) It's still there!	ABBOT	 You could not have been on the Earth a year ago, because there is no Earth to be on -- for at least twenty years.	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 (matter of fact) All dead.	RIPLEY	 (screams) It's still there!	ABBOT	 You could not have been on the Earth a year ago, because there is no Earth to be on -- for at least twenty years.	RIPLEY	 I haven't been floating in space for twenty years.  Let me get to my ship and I'll prove it.	Alien 3 
TRIBUNAL MEMBER	 This woman is a danger.  She denies The New Dark Age.  She denies reality.	RIPLEY	 This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must have stowed away on my ship -- must have killed -- (swallows hard) Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me. You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like an egg - grows - (mimes) Explodes out of you - keeps growing into some sort of monster.  Kills you -- Kills all of you...	RIPLEY	 Who are you people?  Look at you -- all of you -- the way you're dressed.  This isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space -- on a artifical planet.  What are you doing out here?	RIPLEY	 Isn't there anyone here who will listen?	Alien 3 
JOHN	 You didn't see this thing -- this demon -- Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.	ABBOT	 (realizes) That's right.  You both did. (beat) And what was it?	JOHN	 I -- I don't know what it was.  But I don't think Ripley was a party to it.	ABBOT	 She admits she brought it.	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 You haven't seen a woman in thirty years. Where does this feeling originate, John?	JOHN	 (points to his head) Here.	ABBOT	 I believe you.  But your feelings are fooling you.	JOHN	 It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 I mean it.	JOHN	 (slowly) Yes, Father.					Alien 3 
KYLE	 Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?	JOHN	 (panting) Yes.  Devil.	WHISPERING MONKS	 He's got it...	SECOND WHISPERING MONK	 Like the Comet Woman...	Alien 3 
ABBOT O/S	 What?	BALD TRIBUNAL MONK	 I don't -- AAH -- (note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off. I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)	ABBOT	 Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?			Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Whatever.	ANTHONY	 And they've only chose to live the life style, they don't believe they're -- (hears something) What's that?					Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 I can't help you.	JOHN	 Puh. (pant) Please.	RIPLEY	 It never ends.			Alien 3 
JOHN	 We're supposed to protect them.	RIPLEY	 (to Anthony) And what does an android have to do with all this?	JOHN	 He's a spy.	ANTHONY	 The Company planted me here.	Alien 3 
ANTHONY	 I told them.  After the supply ship's stopped coming I saw no point in keeping up the charade.  Since I was a sort of walking reminder of technology, they cast me down.	RIPLEY	 Join the club. (to John) I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be prudent to try to preserve man's written works for generations -- without women.	RIPLEY	 And I don't know about your New Plague, but I was just on Earth and everything's fine.	RIPLEY	 I was right about the Alien, wasn't I? Means I must be right about the Earth.	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 I was right about the Alien, wasn't I? Means I must be right about the Earth.	JOHN	 (beat) Perhaps.	RIPLEY	 That's better than nothing.  Come on.			Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Right.  And this is...	ANTHONY	 This orbiter was patterned after a medieval concept of the universe -- (makes a circle in the air) They call the top half "Heaven - "	JOHN	 The Abbey, the fields --	ANTHONY	 The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.	Alien 3 
JOHN	 That's five levels up --	ANTHONY	 (points into the gloom) On the other side of the orbiter.	JOHN	 A chance.	RIPLEY	 All right.  You've got me - so far. But here's the deal:  I don't know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there, but if we make it to my ship, you're all coming with me.  We'll take as many of your precious books as we can carry, but we're going.  I'm not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again.  Understand?	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 I saw the inside of your cell.	ANTHONY	 (shrugs) My head is full of them.  I try to get them out any way I can.	JOHN	 You need sleep.	ANTHONY	 I know that.  I'll settle for rest.	Alien 3 
JOHN	 What do you mean?	RIPLEY	 I've faced this evil twice before - I guess I've gotten sensitive to it -- (beat) You're really a Doctor?	JOHN	 See my bag?	RIPLEY	 What's that book?	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 In a few hours that's going to sound good.  Going in and out of suspended animation - Christ I probably haven't eaten in a year.	ANTHONY	 (without opening eyes) You should've eaten the bread.	RIPLEY AND JOHN	 Rest!	JOHN	 You all right?	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Are you sure you're a doctor?	JOHN	 Sort of.  My father passed on when we first came here.  The Abbey's Physician - Father Anselm - took me in.  He really raised me -- (pause) Taught me what he could before he passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.	RIPLEY	 Well, I'm just hungry.	JOHN	 You haven't eaten since I took you out of your tube.	Alien 3 
JOHN	 Blood. (sniffs) Mixed with sea water.	ANTHONY	 We're getting close to the center of the arc -- near the sea.	RIPLEY	 Blood.			Alien 3 
JOHN	 Father --	RIPLEY	 (sarcastic) What are you doing down here, father? You look like you've seen something that doesn't exist.	ABBOT	 I was their spiritual leader.  I was not prepared to lead them in battle. Not against that thing.	JOHN	 No one could be.	Alien 3 
ABBOT	 John - what are you doing?	RIPLEY	 He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone: Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path. (proud of him) Good work, Father John.	JOHN	 Brother.	RIPLEY	 Brother.  Let's go.	Alien 3 
JOHN	 I just - are you allright?	RIPLEY	 Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just feel my age. (smiles) Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a hundred.	JOHN	 Hello?	JOHN	 I think this is it.	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.	ABBOT	 (to Ripley) Go ahead.	RIPLEY	 Go ahead and what?	ABBOT	 Open the door, woman.	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 What are you writing?	JOHN	 Last will and testament. (beat) Just kidding.	RIPLEY	 Is he --?	JOHN	 Resting. (shakes his head) He'll be fine.	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 Is he --?	JOHN	 Resting. (shakes his head) He'll be fine.	ANTHONY	 No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.	RIPLEY	 I'm sorry.	Alien 3 
JOHN	 Ripley, wait --	ABBOT	 Where can she go?  She's trapped. (beat) Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing. Sparklets of light - dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof...	ABBOT	 RidingthewildwindsofchangeNoescapeNo escapeforthewickedEvilEvilthynameis woman.Woman.Womanheiscoming.Heiscoming foryouuuuuuuuu --*	RIPLEY	 BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking head!	Alien 3 
JOHN	 This is the glassworks.  They have tools here -- (spots) Kyle --	KYLE	 (sotto) Can't see my baby. Don't see my baby.  Bay be.	JOHN	 Kyle.  Brother Kyle.	KYLE	 Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup. Black king on red queen, put the ace up --	Alien 3 
JOHN	 Saw that happen to a bottle once.	RIPLEY	 (panting) Beat... Beat him - ugh --	JOHN	 We've got to get to the Library --	RIPLEY	 Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --	Alien 3 
JOHN	 What?!  You can't --	RIPLEY	 I figured it out.  That's why it didn't kill me.  He must have impregnated me when I was in the stasis tube. (remembers nightmare) It hasn't come out yet because I haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So either I eat and it kills me or I don't eat and I starve to death.  Either way I die.	JOHN	 My book -- I know what to do --	RIPLEY	 What, an exorcism?  No good.	Alien 3 
JOHN	 You can't do this.  Ripley - listen to me - you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin - I can help you --	RIPLEY	 (ignoring) I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes the Colony's gravitational pull this compartment will open.  Then all you have to do is get into the Stasis tube with Mattias and press the blue button.  With any luck a freighter or something will pick you up.  Good luck.	JOHN	 NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this. You can't let it win.	RIPLEY	 It always wins.  We killed it, but it's still inside me -- You're my last chance. If I can keep you alive it'll make up for all those I've lost.	Alien 3 
RIPLEY	 What is this stuff?	JOHN	 (forceful) Something that will make you well. Something that will make you sick.	RIPLEY	 I don't --	JOHN	 Shut up and drink.	Alien 3
