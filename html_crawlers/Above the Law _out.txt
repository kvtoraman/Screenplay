FOX	 We're all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map. 10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home   in the jungle.	11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON	 snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.

FOX	 (to Zagon) They're in there.	NICO	 I don't trust these yo-yo's.	15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP	 We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.			Above the Law 
ZAGON	 Don't you die on me, fucker --	FOX	 (from the side) What the hell's wrong?	ZAGON	 (throws the prisoner down) This pussy can't hold his liquor.	23   NICO	 enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico, but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove it to the others, too.	Above the Law

25   SECOND PRISONER	 watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties, scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't back down an inch.	ZAGON	 (to second prisoner) So my little doctor bag doesn't                      * scare you, eh? Well I don't need                     * it to open your yap.                                 * Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the blade in the lantern light.	26   NICO	 watches impassively.	ZAGON (O.S.)	 (to prisoner) Where's our load, you sack of slime? What did you do with my shit? --	Above the Law

What did you do with my shit? --	27   ZAGON	 punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner crashes  sideways, face bloody --	ZAGON	 I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium --	Above the Law 
29   NICO		ZAGON	 (to prisoner) You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? You took it from the Chinks... you took it from the French. You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping -- Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner.	ZAGON	 -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy. You're gonna sing like a choir --	NICO	 What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence?	Above the Law 
ZAGON	 Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico --	FOX	 (to Nico) Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.	ZAGON	 (to second prisoner) I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon.	NICO	 (can't take much more) Fox --	Above the Law

The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment.

35   ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD	 Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating relatives.	LUKICH	 (indicates Nico across the patio) Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago.	36   TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES	 BRANCA and LUIGI, who   look like they have been on the other side of a cop's work,   are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson -- plus a cluster of   other cops in civvies hovering around the buffet table like   vultures.	BRANCA	 Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal and they come out like flies.	Above the Law 
UNCLE GUISEPPE	 Let your family help you, Nico.	NICO	 (lightly) Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know. Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.   For the moment, the tension is dispelled.					Above the Law 
NICO	 Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose.	FIRST ARMY JACKET	 (to others) I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here. The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy).	NICO	 You seen this girl?	SECOND ARMY JACKET	 I seen the top of her head.	Above the Law 
NICO	 Come on, motherfuckers.    Do it. Do it! One man -- Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about to tear his face off --	BAD DUDE	 Upstairs! (in terror) She's upstairs! 4-D! Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.     Holding him, Nico turns, glowering, to all.	NICO	 You cocksuckers are brave enough			Above the Law 
NICO	 That's four. (twisting the   Pimp's neck toward   Lucy) She'll get you eight   more. And I'm just warming up   -- Lucy is crying hysterically.

JACKSON	 I don't get you, Toscani. (beat) What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background? For a long moment Nico says nothing.   Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead:	NICO	 When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded. He turns to Jackson.	NICO	 You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway -- (smiles a moment) -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons --			Above the Law

COP (O.S.)	 You can see your client. As soon as she's through eating her dinner. 65    INT. POLICE LOCKUP - "CAGE" AND HALLWAY - EVENING Hookers, female addicts, etc. in the downtown "cage." Nico has the girl in the red dress and lizard shoes (CARLA DECARLO) out in the hallway adjacent to the lock- up. Nico is Mr. Charm, offering her a heart-shaped box of chocolates.	NICO	 Carla... Carla -- I just want the name of your boyfriend --	CARLA	 I got 200 boyfriends. The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in Spanish.			Above the Law 
CARLA	 Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!	JACKSON	 (to Nico) Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever treat someone with a little respect?	NICO	 (walking away) Take it easy, sister.

74   BOOTH NEAR BACK HALLWAY	 The owner's table. Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox and calculator, full ashtrays, wine glasses. BAUTISTA SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a tux with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus- cular, scar-faced Latin busboy -- the kind who looks like he does more for his boss than clean up the tables. The busboy (NARDO) is nervous, apologetic --	SALVANO	 (pissed off) -- I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.	NARDO	 (scared) I'm sorry, boss.

PIPE MAN	 We ain't gonna shoot you, man. We gonna beat you to death. You gonna learn what it means to 'get down.'	191   QUICK CUTS	 A)   Nico is  trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi- ness.   Then: (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash- ing, half-unconscious. C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc, blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in pain. D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow, flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail- ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with just his head and shoulders dangling free.					Above the Law 
199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY	 Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.	MACHETE MAN	 (to Nico, in terror) No, hermano. Please --	NICO	 Who put up the money?	MACHETE MAN	 What money?	Above the Law 
MACHETE MAN	 What money?	NICO	 You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. (twists the youth's neck) Who paid you?	MACHETE MAN	 I told ya!    No one! Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.	NICO	 (shouting) Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow.	Above the Law

BRANCA	 He's fine.   The boy has ribs of steel!	ROSA	 (touching Nico's brow) Enough of your humor. Sara clings to Nico's arm, tears in her eyes. Rosa               * crosses herself.

SARA	 -- You've got to do it, Nico.    You know you have to. Whatever Sara is proposing, Nico is dead set against it.	ROSA	 Listen to her, Nicola. (dead serious) Whatever you think of him, Federico is family. He is our family. Nico makes no response.   Instead, he lifts Julian, nuzzles him tenderly.	NICO	 Ever notice how clean babies smell? Like nothing in the world has touched them yet.	SARA	 If you won't go to him, I will.	Above the Law 
SARA	 If you won't go to him, I will.	NICO	 (in pain) Don't push me like this -- Her eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate.	SARA	 Branca can put us on a plane -- but where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There's nowhere they can't find us.	NICO	 You don't know what the hell you're talking about.	Above the Law 
NICO	 You know I can't go to him. Sara takes both his hands in hers.	SARA	 Do you know why I love you? Do you know what it is about you that I've always loved? (as Nico fights his own emotion) Pride. It's what you have inside. You don't live the way other people live. You trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it.	SARA (O.S.)	 But now that pride may kill all of us. (beat) You've got to swallow that pride, Nico. Choke on it if you have to. Lay it aside.	339   ANOTHER ANGLE - NICO AND SARA	 Close together, with their baby between them. Sara buries her face against her husband's chest. Nico's arm	Above the Law 
NICO	 Kurt Zagon.	FREDERICO LARUSSO	 -- As long as this Zagon lives, nothing I can do will guarantee your family's safety. (beat) 'Ecce non uomine, ecce bestie.' You know Dante? (translates) 'These are not men, these are animals.'	FREDERICO LARUSSO	 Memorize this address.	FREDERICO LARUSSO	 Have you got it in your mind? Nico nods.    Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds.             *	Above the Law 
FREDERICO LARUSSO	 Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you will give my love to my niece, Rosa.	NICO	 I will do that, Mr. Larusso. (sincerely) I hope you will be well.	350   LARUSSO	 nods: "Bene." Then: without a word he turns and exits			Above the Law 
FOX	 Close range, huh? Never work. Place is rigged, scanned every 35 seconds.	NICO	 (back still turned) I was thinking of a mine on the roof. Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in.	FOX	 Roof's wired too.   Sensors every fifteen feet. Fox's finger rests ready on the trigger.	FOX	 You can turn now.   Slowly.   Slooowly... Nico turns. We see Fox clearly now. His boyish features have weathered since his "spook" days in Vietnam. There is grey in his hair now: he wears an expensive suit and is alone.	Above the Law 
FOX	 Getting a bit of a tire.	NICO	 (indicates Fox's suit) Your own tailor?	FOX	 Hong Kong.	NICO	 You've gone a long way. Fox motions for Nico to dump his gun; Nico complies, dropping it gently into the briefcase. Nico takes half a step toward Fox. Fox shakes his head in warning.	Above the Law 
NICO	 You've gone a long way. Fox motions for Nico to dump his gun; Nico complies, dropping it gently into the briefcase. Nico takes half a step toward Fox. Fox shakes his head in warning.

FOX	 Why not?   The Romans did.	NICO	 (to Fox, watching the guests) Are we the Romans?	FOX	 We're an empire too.	FOX	 Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin? (losing patience) I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep under, no names, no numbers --	Above the Law 
NICO	 (presses closer) We've wiped out entire fucking countries. And not one agent --	FOX	 (moves gun into Nico's view) Stop right there!	NICO	 (doesn't stop) -- not one C.I.A. agent has ever been tried or convicted, much less accused of any crimes.

NICO	 Well... well.    What a team we have here.	ZAGON	 (calls, friendly) We've been looking for you, Nelson.    I see you've found our friend.	NICO	 Thanks for the help, Fox.	FOX	 I didn't bring him, Nico.    I swear it!	Above the Law 
ZAGON	 Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?	FOX	 Stay still! (to Nico) Don't fucking move!!	EVENING GOWN WOMAN	 (grabs her husband's arm) Jack --	ZAGON	 Bring in our friend, Nelson. Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico --	Above the Law

FOX	 Dive, Nico!! He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down, a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety.	ZAGON	 (to first agent, advancing) Move! Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. He  joins Zagon, rushing forward --	373   RAMP TO LOWER LEVELS	 A valet rounds a corner, unsuspecting, bringing up a car. Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the poor boy from behind the wheel, leaping in --	374    ZAGON AND SALVANO	 tear around the corner at the top of the ramp.    Both OPEN FIRE as --	Above the Law 
386   TWO UNIFORMED HOTEL SECURITY GUARDS	 hurtle around the corner from the escalators, guns drawn.	FIRST SECURITY GUARD	 (shouts to Zagon) You there --	387   NICO - OUT OF CAR		388   ZAGON'S KNIFE		Above the Law 
406   ZAGON		ZAGON	 We've got an hour before the honorable senator. (hands towel to pistol agent) You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses.	NICO	 How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen? The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.	ZAGON	 I've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- (lifts a needle to the light) -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun.	Above the Law

ZAGON	 (to agents) Take his arms. Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,         * seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head.	ZAGON	 Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance.	Above the Law
