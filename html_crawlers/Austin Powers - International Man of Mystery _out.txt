Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with one	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
DR. EVIL	 (to evil associates) Gentlemen, in exactly five days from now, we will be one-hundred billion dollars richer. (laughing) Ha-ha-ha-ha. (slightly louder) Ha-ha-ha-ha.	EVIL ASSOCIATES	 (laughing with him) Ha-ha-ha-ha.	DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES		(LOUDER AND MORE STACCATO)		Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
(LOUDER AND MORE STACCATO)		HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!	 (louder again, and even more evil and maniacal)	HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!		(PAUSE)	 Ohhhh, ahhhhhh... (pause, quieter) Ohhh, hmmmm. (pause, very quiet) hmn.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!		(PAUSE)	 Ohhhh, ahhhhhh... (pause, quieter) Ohhh, hmmmm. (pause, very quiet) hmn.	DR. EVIL	 Okay...Well...I think I'm going to watch some TV.	EVIL ASSOCIATES	 Okay.  Sure.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
BASIL EXPOSITION	 What?	AUSTIN	 Circus folk. (shudders) Nomads, you know.  They smell like cabbage.	BASIL EXPOSITION	 (suffering him) Indeed...If we could get back to the business at hand.  It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.	AUSTIN	 Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle. (hands him the photos) I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan.  It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

VANESSA	 Austin, have you gone mad?	MRS. EXPOSITION	 (through pain) Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?	BASIL EXPOSIION	 Don't worry, mother.  Lie down. Austin, you have a lot of explaining to do.	AUSTIN	 I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTIN	 I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.	BASIL EXPOSITION	 I'm leaving! (pause) Oh, and Austin?	AUSTIN	 Yes, Basil?	BASIL EXPOSITION	 Be careful.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTIN	 Don't be sorry.  You're right to be suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged her rotten.	VANESSA	 (stunned) I can't believe you made love to her just like that.  Did you use protection?	AUSTIN	 Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.	VANESSA	 No, did you use a condom?	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTIN	 Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.	VANESSA	 (pause) Well, it means something to me.  If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.	AUSTIN	 It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're everything to me.	VANESSA	 You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
SON 1	 (crying) I love you, Dad.	DAD 1	 I love you, Son.	THERAPIST	 That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you.  OK, group, we have two new member.  Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr....Ehville?			Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
GROUP	 Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.	SCOTT EVIL	 (into it) Hello, everybody.	THERAPIST	 So, Scott, why don't we start with you.  Why are you here?	SCOTT EVIL	 Well, it's kind of weird.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
DR. EVIL	 An evil petting zoo?	SCOTT EVIL	 (shouting) You always do that! (calm) Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.	THERAPIST	 We don't label people here, Scott.	SCOTT EVIL	 No, he's really evil.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTIN	 Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you have a piece of gum?	VANESSA	 (in her own world) Do you think she's prettier than I?	AUSTIN	 Who?	VANESSA	 You know who.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTTIN	 Well put.  Listen love, we can't keep having this fight.  I'm an International Man of Mystery. Sometimes in the course of my work to save the world I have to shag some crumpet.  It's all part of the job.	TOUR GUIDE	 Welcome to Virtucon, the company of the future.

MIDDLE AGED LADY	 Hello? (pause) Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin. (pause) Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin. (pause) Yes, that's right, he's a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. (pause) What?  Killed? (pause) How? (pause) Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my God.  Thank you for calling.	FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD	 Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home? He said he was going to teach me to play ball.	MRS. HARWIN	 Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news.  As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army.			Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
MRS. HARWIN	 Your brother was run over by a steamroller.	BILLY	 A steamroller? (bursting into tears) No, not Steve!  Since Dad died, Steve's been like a father to me.	MRS. HARWIN	 I'm sorry son.  People never think how things affect the family of the henchman. (hugging him) I love you, Billy. (to herself, out loud) I wonder if we'll be able to receive Steve's henchman's comp.

DR. EVIL	 Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.	AUSTIN	 (under his breath to Vanessa) Does that make you horny?	VANESSA	 (under her breath) Not now, Austin.	DR. EVIL	 The world's most powerful subterranean drill.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTIN	 (under his breath to Vanessa) Does that make you horny?	VANESSA	 (under her breath) Not now, Austin.	DR. EVIL	 The world's most powerful subterranean drill.			Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
DR. EVIL	 (voice over) So powerful it can penetrate the Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton nuclear warhead into the planet's hot liquid core.  Upon detonation, every volcano on the planet will erupt.	AMERICAN UN REPRESENTATIVE	 Why should we pay him the money? He's only got one warhead and he's going to detonate it deep underground.	BASIL EXPOSITION	 (the light shifts towards dramatic as he speaks) My God, man, don't you understand? It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes.  Imagine no United Kingdom.  Think of it, no cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted crumpets smothered with Devonshire clotted cream, the diving mystery of Stonehenge.  Imagine severing forever the continuity of Britannic majesty, the demise of this sceptered isle, this jewel, this England...			Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

SCOTT EVIL	 Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.	DR. EVIL	 (trying to hide contempt) Fascinating.  What are your plans for this evening?	SCOTT EVIL	 Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.	DR. EVIL	 And that's how you want to live your life, is it?	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
AUSTIN	 Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?	DR. EVIL	 No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die.  Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. (to guard) All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.	DR. EVIL	 Release the sharks! (to the room) All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads.  I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.

FRAU FARBISSINA	 (clearing her throat nervously) Dr. Evil?	DR. EVIL	 Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting my moment of triumph.	FRAU FARBISSINA	 It's about the sharks.  Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.  We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
FRAU FARBISSINA	 It's about the sharks.  Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.  We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.	DR. EVIL	 (disappointed) Right. (to Austin) Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.	DR. EVIL	 What is it now?	FRAU FARBISSINA	 Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are.  They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.	Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery 
FRAU FARBISSINA	 Please allow me to demonstrate.	DR. EVIL	 Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill- tempered sea bass it is. (to the room) Come, let's return to dinner.  Close the tank.	SCOTT EVIL	 Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!	DR. EVIL	 No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.

AUSTIN	 Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened.
