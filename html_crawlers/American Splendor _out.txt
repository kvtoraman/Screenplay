ANGLE ON BED		HARVEY	 (faintly) Joyce... Joyce?	JOYCE	 What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up?	JOYCE	 What is it?	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 What is it?	HARVEY	 (delirious, out of breath) Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- am I just a character in that book?	JOYCE	 Harvey...	HARVEY	 If I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away...	American Splendor 
CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK		BOYS	 (in unison) Trick or treat!!	HOUSEWIFE	 Well, look at this! All the superheroes on the porch! Ain't that cute.	HOUSEWIFE	 (still yelling) We got Superman here, Batman, his sidekick ROBIN, ohh, The Green Lantern even...	American Splendor 
HOUSEWIFE	 Who are you supposed to be?	KID	 I'm Harvey Pekar (pronounced "Pee Car").	HOUSEWIFE	 Harvey Pekar? That doesn't sound like a super hero to me...	BOYS	 (mumbling) Pecker, Pecker...	American Splendor 
HOUSEWIFE	 Harvey Pekar? That doesn't sound like a super hero to me...	BOYS	 (mumbling) Pecker, Pecker...	KID	 I ain't no super hero, lady. I'm just a kid from the neighborhood, alright?	KID	 Ahh, forget this...	American Splendor 
DOCTOR #1	 Bad timing, I guess. Now please say "Ah," Mr. Pekar.	HARVEY	 "Ahhh." (without missing a beat) "Ahhh" ruined the trip. I got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back. I mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched. What if she totally forgets what I'm like? Man, it's torture --	DOCTOR #1	 Shhh...	DOCTOR #1	 Uh-huh.	American Splendor 
DOCTOR #1	 Uh-huh.	HARVEY	 (the penlight in his mouth) What? Is it bad, doc?	DOCTOR #1	 It's not good.	HARVEY	 It's cancer? First I got marital problems and now yer tellin' me I got throat cancer? Omigod...	American Splendor 
DOCTOR #1	 A few months.	HARVEY	 (loudly) Months!!	DOCTOR #1	 See? More of that and you'll do permanent damage. Now go home, keep your mouth shut, and hopefully we won't have to operate.			American Splendor 
SPANISH WOMAN #1	 Since you can kiss my ass.	HARVEY	 (to himself) Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do it?	WOMAN #2	 (yelling at Harvey) Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone!			American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (to himself) Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do it?	WOMAN #2	 (yelling at Harvey) Ay, what are you looking at? Maricone!					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (shaking his head) They all make it seem so easy.	REAL HARVEY (V.O.)	 Here's our man walking home from the doctor's. He's got the weight of the world on him. And fer what, really? 'Cause his throat's a little screwy? Man, people in India are starvin' to death every day. His problems are nothin'.					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (whispering) Ay... What is this?	LANA	 Exactly what it looks like.	HARVEY	 (loud) Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin' me?! Fer what? (his voice really rips) Ah, shit!			American Splendor 
LANA	 Exactly what it looks like.	HARVEY	 (loud) Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin' me?! Fer what? (his voice really rips) Ah, shit!	LANA	 Look, your plebeian lifestyle isn't working for me anymore. Cleveland's not working for me anymore. I gotta get out of here before I kill myself.	HARVEY	 But --	American Splendor 
NURSE	 Thank you, Harvey dear.	HARVEY	 (to himself) Plebeian... where the hell did she get that shit?					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Huh? That's an A.M.-F.M. radio he's listening to... They got 'em fixed up now like a pair of earmuffs.	MR. BOATS	 (inappropriately angered) MMPH! Isn't that somethin! People have gone crazy. They'll buy any kinda junk! Probably listening to that loud rock stuff. Junk, junk, it's all junk!	HARVEY	 Well, I don't know. Rock music's got some good qualities. I mean it ain't jazz or nothin'.	MR. BOATS	 Say, when you gonna bring me in some good records? Some Nat "King" Cole with Strings...	American Splendor 
MARTY	 C'mon, Harv. You dig Jay McShann. You gonna buy that or what?	HARVEY	 I don't know, Marty. It's got a lamination crack in it... (checking out the price) A quarter. Maybe I can get him down.	MARTY	 You are one cheap bastard Harvey.	HARVEY	 Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I live on a government wage.	American Splendor 
PAHLS	 You should see his comics, Harv. They are outta sight.	HARVEY	 (interested) Yeah? I'm into comics myself.					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 It's terrific, man! I really dig your work.	CRUMB	 (holding up a vintage comic) This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt Kelly... It's pretty rare.	HARVEY	 Yeah? Can I get good bread for it?	CRUMB	 Nah! Not yet.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Listen man, let's get back to your book. What are you gonna do with it?	CRUMB	 (looking up) I hadn't thought about it. It's just an exercise.	HARVEY	 It's more than an exercise. It's breaking ground, man. There's some wild shit in here.	CRUMB	 You're spitting on me, Harvey.	American Splendor 
ANGLE ON CRUMB'S DRAWING		CRUMB	 (laughing) Check it out, man. Pretty scary.	HARVEY	 Yeah, ya don't know the half of it.	REAL HARVEY (V.O.)	 Eventually people got hip to Crumb's art work and he started hangin' out with a Bohemian crowd. After a while, he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground.	American Splendor 
CRUMB	 Uh-huh.	HARVEY	 But don't think I buy into this "growth" crap. Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that clichd stuff. I've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty. (a beat) Right now, I'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness.	HARVEY	 So how long are ya stayin' in Cleveland?	CRUMB	 I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this chick in New York. And I'm really busy with the comic book stuff. It's good bread and all man but I'm getting fed up with the whole scene.	American Splendor 
STYLE COMIC PANEL DEPICTING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. A BUBBLE	 appears over CARTOON HARVEY'S head revealing his thoughts. It reads: "Pickin' the right check-out line is an art... There's a lot of things you gotta consider." ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... Harvey decides to get behind the Old Lady. MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME... Cartoon Harvey stands behind the Old Lady.	OLD JEWISH LADY	 (Yiddish Accent) Listen, goily, dese glasses are six for $2.00 because I couldn't carry twelf... But I vanted twelf so today I'm buying six more... But you should only charge me $1.50 for dem... It's ok, you can esk de meneger.	CASHIER	 (yelling) Frank! I need a price check.	SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECOMES FULLY	 ANIMATED... Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.	American Splendor 
OLD JEWISH LADY	 (Yiddish Accent) Listen, goily, dese glasses are six for $2.00 because I couldn't carry twelf... But I vanted twelf so today I'm buying six more... But you should only charge me $1.50 for dem... It's ok, you can esk de meneger.	CASHIER	 (yelling) Frank! I need a price check.	SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECOMES FULLY	 ANIMATED... Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.	CARTOON HARVEY	 Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything. Get behind them in a line an' yer gonna wait forever!	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 See, ever since I read your stuff, man I've been thinking I could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done.	CRUMB	 (munching on a fry) Uh-huh.	HARVEY	 I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super-hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids. And underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically. But there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know?	CRUMB	 Pass me the ketchup?	American Splendor 
CRUMB	 These are really good, Harv.	HARVEY	 (insecure) Really? Ya think so?	CRUMB	 Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I dig it. Can I take them home and illustrate them?	HARVEY	 Wow!!	American Splendor 
CRUMB	 Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv? All of a sudden it sounds fine.	HARVEY	 (thrilled) I don't know, man! I guess you cured me!					American Splendor 
A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR COMIC BOOK FEATURING THE TWO MATTRESS	 GUYS: Scrawled across the top in big red letters reads, "AMERICAN SPLENDOR. Vol. #1" A man's finger points to the words, "All Stories by Harvey Pekar. Art by R. Crumb." The comic book sits atop a table in the dreary snack room.	HARVEY	 (beaming) See that? All stories by yours truly.	WW II VET PATIENT	 Hot off the presses, huh? We got a regular Hemingway here.	HARVEY	 No way, Jack, I don't go in for that macho crap.	American Splendor 
MARTY	 Hey look guys, here comes Captain America.	PAHLS	 (yelling out) You gonna hang with the boys now that yer a comic book star?	HARVEY	 Cut it out. Man, I ain't nothin' yet compared to Bob Crumb.	GUY #3	 Ah, listen to him. One lousy comic book and he wants to be Crumb.	American Splendor 
TOBY	 Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And I'm a very spiritual person. You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself. It might cheer you up.	HARVEY	 (calling after him) What? Do I seem depressed, Toby?	CLOSE ON HARVEY'S HAND		BOB THE DIRECTOR (V.O.)	 Cut!	American Splendor 
COUNTER GIRL #1	 (yelling to Harvey) Next!	HARVEY	 (to the Counter Girl) Yeah! I'll have two crullers, a jelly donut with powdered sugar... And you got any "day old bread"?	ALICE	 Hey, you're Harvey Pekar.	HARVEY	 Yeah...	American Splendor 
RAND	 Yep.	JOYCE	 (accusatory) Damn it! I put one aside for myself, next to the register. I didn't even get a chance to read it.	RAND	 Whoa, sorry, Joyce. I didn't know you were such a Splendor fan. Next time take it home.	JOYCE	 Maybe I'll call the publisher. But they take so damn long. Shit! Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster...	American Splendor 
HARVEY (V.O.)	 With me. Don't worry, I'm not gonna put no moves on you or anything.	JOYCE	 I'm not worried about that... (fumbling with a tea cup) Hold on, I just spilled chamomile tea all over my bathrobe.	HARVEY (V.O.)	 So what are ya worried about then?	JOYCE	 (sipping) Well, the way all those different artists draw you, I don't quite know what to expect. I mean sometimes you look like a younger Brando, but then the way Crumb draws you -- like a hairy ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body -- it's kind of scary.	American Splendor 
HARVEY (V.O.)	 So what are ya worried about then?	JOYCE	 (sipping) Well, the way all those different artists draw you, I don't quite know what to expect. I mean sometimes you look like a younger Brando, but then the way Crumb draws you -- like a hairy ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body -- it's kind of scary.	HARVEY (V.O.)	 Those are motion lines. I'm an active guy. Anyway, just come out here an' I'll try to be anyone you want me ta be.	JOYCE	 That's a dangerous offer. I'm a notorious reformer...	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 It's fine. What difference does it make?	HARVEY	 I dunno. None, I guess. (beat) They sure got a lot of meat on this menu.	JOYCE	 You're a vegetarian?	HARVEY	 Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore.	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness.	WAITRESS	 (sing song) Good afternoon! I'm your server Cindy! What can I bring you two today?					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Ay Toby.	TOBY	 (mouth full) No you can't have any of my White Castle hamburgers so please don't even ask.	HARVEY	 Can I have a fry?	TOBY	 Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over.	American Splendor 
TOBY	 Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over.	HARVEY	 (munching) Whattya got, a church function?	TOBY	 No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a movie. Would you like to come?	HARVEY	 Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight. I'm gettin' married.	American Splendor 
TOBY	 Oh. Why Delaware?	HARVEY	 The chick I'm marryin' is from Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. (a beat) Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie?	TOBY	 It's not playing at the Mapletown. (a beat) I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey.	HARVEY	 Yeah. We met last week.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 The chick I'm marryin' is from Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. (a beat) Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie?	TOBY	 It's not playing at the Mapletown. (a beat) I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey.	HARVEY	 Yeah. We met last week.	HARVEY	 Toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for?	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 So what yer sayin' is you identify with those nerds?	TOBY	 (rubbing out the catsup) Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And this movie has uplifted me. There's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds. Then, he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward... So nearly everyone in the place does. That's the way the movie ends.	HARVEY	 So the nerds won, huh?	TOBY	 (smiling) Yes.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 So the nerds won, huh?	TOBY	 (smiling) Yes.	HARVEY	 Wow. You got this movie an' I'm gettin' hitched. We both had a good month, huh?	TOBY	 (finishing his last burger) Right. Harvey, how long are you going to be in Delaware because I'd really like to see this movie with you?	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Wow. You got this movie an' I'm gettin' hitched. We both had a good month, huh?	TOBY	 (finishing his last burger) Right. Harvey, how long are you going to be in Delaware because I'd really like to see this movie with you?	HARVEY	 I'm only goin' for a week but then I'll have a wife, so I'll have to take her along. Is it a girl flick?	TOBY	 Depends on the girl. What kind of girl is your new bride? Is she a nerd?	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 Harvey, what did I say about loud talking? Use your inside voice.	HARVEY	 (whispering loudly) Look Toby, the guys in that movie are not 28-year-old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic ghetto.	JOYCE	 That's enough, Harvey.	HARVEY	 They didn't get their computers like you did -- by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49.50 at the supermarket.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain't getting rid of my 78's.	JOYCE	 (angry) Forget it then. I give up! How can I make more storage space, if you won't get rid of anything?	HARVEY	 I'll get rid of stuff. Just not my good stuff.	JOYCE	 Everything's your good stuff. How am I supposed to live here, if there's no room for me?	American Splendor 
ANSWERING MACHINE	 Please leave a message. (Beep)	HARVEY	 (into phone) Hey Joyce, it's me. You're not gonna believe this but some LA producer called an' he wants to do a play about my life. Call me! (Click)	JOYCE	 (to herself) Delusions of grandeur.			American Splendor

JOYCE	 Y'know Harvey, vasectomies are reversible.	HARVEY	 (ignoring her) Damn Yuppies get everything.	JOYCE	 (raising her voice) Are you listening to me? I said vasectomies are reversible.	HARVEY	 What? Whattya talkin' about? I don't want kids. An' I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on ya', right here in this airport.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (ignoring her) Damn Yuppies get everything.	JOYCE	 (raising her voice) Are you listening to me? I said vasectomies are reversible.	HARVEY	 What? Whattya talkin' about? I don't want kids. An' I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on ya', right here in this airport.	JOYCE	 I know but things have changed. I think we can be a family.	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 I'll take care of the kid and you.	HARVEY	 (dead serious) No way Joyce. Forget it. I can't do it; I can't have no kids.					American Splendor 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)	 Joyce diagnosed herself as "clinically depressed." I don't know what the hell she was goin' through but it was sure takin' it's toll on me.	HARVEY	 (upbeat) We can go out for dinner tonight. How 'bout catching a bite at Tommy's?	JOYCE	 (mumbling) I'm not hungry.	HARVEY	 I give up.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (upbeat) We can go out for dinner tonight. How 'bout catching a bite at Tommy's?	JOYCE	 (mumbling) I'm not hungry.	HARVEY	 I give up.	HARVEY	 Hey Joyce, we got a message here. Why didn't you pick up.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Hey, you got anything ta eat? My stomach's growling.	STAGE MANAGER	 (checking his watch) There's no time to eat now.	LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE		LETTERMAN	 Okay. Our next guest works as a file clerk in a Cleveland hospital.	American Splendor 
LETTERMAN	 ...He also writes comic books which detail his day-to-day pains and pleasures, and this is an anthology of nine of those comics. It's entitled AMERICAN SPLENDOR... From off the streets of Cleveland, please say hello to Harvey Pekar.	THE HARVEY PEKAR WHO WALKS ONTO THE SET IS NOT THE ACTOR	 PORTRAYING HIM BUT RATHER THE REAL HARVEY PEKAR (only about 15 years younger). THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE FROM HARVEY'S FIRST LETTERMAN APPEARANCE.					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 I'm ready for those Cleveland jokes. Go ahead...	LETTERMAN	 Alright settle down Harvey. Settle down. (the Audience laughs) Now let's explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work what it is you do here, exactly. You have comic books about you in your daily life in Cleveland.	HARVEY	 That's right.	LETTERMAN	 And are they embellished at all or is it pretty much factual?	American Splendor 
LETTERMAN	 And are they embellished at all or is it pretty much factual?	HARVEY	 (patronizing) No. It's all true, David. All true.	LETTERMAN	 And you also have a regular job in Cleveland working at a hospital.	HARVEY	 That's right. Aiding the sick, yes.	American Splendor 
ANGLE ON JOYCE WATCHING		JOYCE	 (unimpressed) Such brilliant repartee...	LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE		LETTERMAN	 Now it seems to me Harvey that you have a very successful career here. This is being published by a major publishing company, Doubleday. Why do you maintain the day job?	American Splendor 
LETTERMAN	 Now it seems to me Harvey that you have a very successful career here. This is being published by a major publishing company, Doubleday. Why do you maintain the day job?	HARVEY	 (defensive) To make a living! (big laughs) I don't make a living as a writer. I've been writing for many years, David. Maybe more years than you've been alive.					American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Yeah, I know that my youthful appearance belies, you know, my actual age. But, I've been around for a long time --	LETTERMAN REGULAR	 (to JOYCE) You know this guy?	JOYCE	 I'm beginning to wonder.	LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE		American Splendor 
ANGLE ON LETTERMAN REGULAR		LETTERMAN REGULAR	 (to Joyce) At least he's keeping up with Letterman.	JOYCE	 Pandering is more like it.	JOYCE	 Damnit.	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 Finally something good. (to Letterman Regular) Watch this.	LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE CLOSE-UP OF THE DOLL		LETTERMAN	 They're made out of your old clothing.			American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Thirty-four bucks.	LETTERMAN	 (shocked) Thirty-four dollars? Thirty-four dollars for this?	HARVEY	 What are ya cheap. You cheaper than me?	LETTERMAN	 Would you pay thirty-four dollars for that?	American Splendor 
REAL HARVEY (V.O.)	 Here was this slick, ambitious guy with millions, winnin' over the country by makin' light of everything. And then there was me... A messy loser with no dough who takes everything too seriously.	LETTERMAN	 Tell me Harvey, what do you do to get away from the pressure of being -- well, a file clerk? (laughter)	HARVEY	 Go ahead and laugh, folks. But he has more contempt for you than I do!			American Splendor 
MTV DIRECTOR	 Christ! Watch where you're going!	HARVEY	 (muttering) Fuckin' yuppie or whatever kinda freak you are.	REAL HARVEY (V.O.)	 That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations. We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system.  What can I say, it was the 80's man.			American Splendor 
JOYCE	 (looking up from the paper) Harvey, I've been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones... Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians, Cambodians... These kids are amazing and they're --	YUPPIE	 Hey, you're that guy from the Letterman show, right?	HARVEY	 (smiling) Yeah, that's me.			American Splendor 
YUPPIE	 Hey, you're that guy from the Letterman show, right?	HARVEY	 (smiling) Yeah, that's me.	YUPPIE	 That's so excellent. You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot.	HARVEY	 Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my comics, man. That's the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway.	American Splendor 
JOYCE	 Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a damn about the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me. Something that matters.	HARVEY	 (furious) Hey! You know I only go on the show for the extra bread!	JOYCE	 Harvey... you're yelling...	HARVEY	 Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?!	American Splendor 
MIGUEL	 Harvey, that patient's due t'be admitted a week from now! Why do you always have to be picking fights with everybody?	HARVEY	 (yelling) How many times do we gotta go through the same bullshit. Just gimme the fuckin' chart!	MIGUEL	 We'll see what the doctor says about this.			American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (loudly into phone) Whadya mean? Another two weeks? Ya gotta come home some time! Hello?	DAMNIT!						American Splendor 
LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.)	 Y'know ladies and gentlemen, when Thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression, he obviously had not met our first guest, who happens to lead a life of whining desperation...	HARVEY	 (threatening) Okay, asshole. You'll pay for that one...	LETTERMAN REGULAR (O.S.)	 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, Harvey Pekar.			American Splendor 
JOYCE	 I guess you did it this time.	HARVEY	 Who cares. He wasn't helpin' my sales anyway. (moving closer) Baby, don't go away anymore. I just can't take bein' alone.	JOYCE	 If you met those kids over there and saw what they go through, you wouldn't ask that of me.	HARVEY	 But if you go again I'm really gonna lose it.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 (faintly) Joyce... Joyce?	JOYCE	 What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up?	JOYCE	 What is it?			American Splendor 
JOYCE	 What is it?	HARVEY	 (delirious, out of breath) Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- just a character in that book?	JOYCE	 Harvey...	HARVEY	 When I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Ya keep readin' 'em backward.	DANIELLE	 I like reading them backward. (holding up a comic) Is that you?	HARVEY	 I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me, man.	DANIELLE	 You look like a monster.	American Splendor 
HARVEY	 Ya know, you should write about things in your own life. Like school and... ponies... I don't know, girl stuff...	DANIELLE	 (to Harvey) Do you have to hold my hand?	HARVEY	 (wounded) What, are you embarrassed a' me? I know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the same way about my father.	DANIELLE	 No Harvey. You're just squeezing it too hard. (shaking her head) Joyce is right. You are obsessive compulsive.	American Splendor 
DANIELLE	 (to Harvey) Do you have to hold my hand?	HARVEY	 (wounded) What, are you embarrassed a' me? I know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the same way about my father.	DANIELLE	 No Harvey. You're just squeezing it too hard. (shaking her head) Joyce is right. You are obsessive compulsive.	REAL HARVEY (V.O.)	 Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a lot. But don't think this is some sunny, happy ending. Every day is still a major struggle. Joyce an' I fight like crazy, an' she barely works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a real handful. My expenses have gone up so much that I'm writin' freelance 'round the clock, just to make my bills. My life is total chaos.	American Splendor
