THE 25th HOUR



     by



David Benioff

                INDUSTRY ENTERTAINMENT





     EXT . WES T SIDE HIGHWAY -- NIGHT




o    A blac k dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway, head
     between his paws , curled up next to the barricad e that
     separates the north and southbound lanes .



     Traffic rumbles past him: yellow cabs , blu e polic e cruisers ,
     white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates .



     We hea r the squeal of brakes. A black *65 Ford Mustang, min t
     condition, pulls onto the shoulder, ten yard s past the dog ,
     and back s up . Th e dog raises its head.



    Two me n step out of the car.          The driver , MONT Y BROGAN, mid -
    twenties , is pale-skinned in          the flickering light . A small
    silver crucifix hangs from a           silver chain around his neck ;
    his fingers are adorned with           silver rings .



    The passenger , KOSTYA NOVOTNY, a hulking ma n in his late
    thirties , blow s his nose in his handkerchief.
    It's a cold night . Monty wears a camel's hai r overcoat,
    Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat .

                           MONTY

                 He's alive.

                            KOSTYA

                      (Ukrainian accent)
                 This dog, how do you call it?

                            MONTY

                 Pit bull . Must have lost somebody some
                 money .
    The dog stares at them and they stare at the dog .

                             KOSTYA

                 What d o w e do , Monty, w e watch hi m rot ?

     ' .-  ' ? -. :  - ' MONTY : . '  '' ' ' ;:; '' '


     :                                   "                          " -




                   I was thinking of shooting him .




                           KOSTYA

                 Shooting him? Ar e you sick in the head ?



    The dog continues to stare at them impassively, his face lit
    by the passing headlights. The pavement by hi s paws is
    littered with broken glass, twisted scraps of metal , black
    rubber from blow n tires.









                                                                                     o

                                                                       (CONTINUED)

                      MONTY

            They just left him here to die. They
            threw him out the window and kept
            driving.
 A ship's horn sounds from the Hudson.

                     KOSTYA

           Come, my friend, it is cold. Come, people
           wait for us.

                     MONTY

           They're used to waiting.
Monty squats near the dog and inspects him. From this angle
it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused. One ear
has been chewed to mince; his hide is scored with cigarette
burns; flies crawl in his bloodied fur.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

           I think maybe his hip --
The dog pounces, jaws snapping,; lunging for Monty's face.
Monty stumbles backwards. The dog, too badly injured to
continue the attack, remains in his crouch, growling.
Monty sits on the pavement, shaking his head.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

          Christ.
               (beat)
          He's got some bite left.

                    KOSTYA

          I think he does not want to play with
          you. Come, you want police to pull over?
          You want police looking through your car?

                    MONTY

          Look what they did to him. Used him for a
          fucking ashtray.
Monty stands and dusts his palms on the seat of his pants.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          Let's get him in the trunk.

                    KOSTYA

          What?










                                                   (CONTINUED)





                                                                    3.

                         MONTY

               There's a vet emergency room on the East
               Side. I like this guy.

                         KOSTYA

               You like him? He tries to bite your face
               off. Look at him, he is meat. You want
               some dog, I buy you.nice puppy tomorrow.
Monty is not listening. He walks back to his car, opens the
trunk, pulls out a soiled green army blanket.
Kostya holds up his hands: stop.

                      KOSTYA    (CONT'D)

           Wait one minute,    please. Please stop one
           minute? I do not    go near pit bull. Monty?
           I do not go near    pit bull.
Monty, carrying the army blanket, walks back toward the dog.

                     MONTY

           This is a good dog. I can see it in his
           eyes. He's a tough little bastard.

                     KOSTYA

           Sometimes I think you are very stupid
           man.
The dog has slumped back to the pavement. His breath, comes in.
shorts rasps and wheezes. But he never takes his eyes off the
two men.

                     MONTY

           We wait much longer, he'll be dead.

                     KOSTYA

           One minute ago you want to shoot him.

                     MONTY

           That was a mercy thing. But he's not
           ready to go yet.

                     KOSTYA

           Yes? He told you this?
Monty slowly circles behind the dog, holding the blanket the
way a matador wields his cape.

                       MONTY

          Distrac t him.

                                                                         U

 CONTINUED: (3)







 Kostya stares at his friend in disbelief. He looks down. A
 crumpled soda can lies by his feet. He kicks the can.
 The dog's head pivots to follow the aluminum flash.
 Monty hurls the blanket over the dog and spring forward,
 wrapping his arms around the dog's midsection. The dog
 growls, bites the wool, tries to break the blanket's neck.
 Monty lurches toward the Mustang, struggling to retain his
 bearhug while the pit bull slithers in his grasp. As they
 stumble closer to the car the dog releases the blanket and
 snaps at Monty's throat.
Monty hurls the dog into the trunk and slams the lid. He
returns to the driver's seat.
Kostya watches him in silence, stares at the sky for a few
seconds, finally gets back in the car. The dog thrashes in
the trunk.

INT. MUSTANG

Both men sit in silence as Monty revs the engine. Blood is
beginning to leak from a bite on the right side of Monty's
neck.

                      KOSTYA

            What goes on in your little head?
Monty grins. He has no idea that he's bleeding.

                      MONTY

            I got him, didn't I? Surprised you how
      .--   quick I was, huh?
Monty checks for traffic and pulls back onto the highway.

                      KOSTYA

            Yes, you are so quick.
He points at the wound on Monty's neck, which has begun to
flow faster.

                      KOSTYA (CONT'D)

            Meanwhile, you are bleeding.

                      MONTY

            That's the dog's blood.

                       KOSTYA

            Oh? Because you have hole in your neck
            and blood is coining out.

 o           DOYLE (for the nameless pit bull has become Doyle) growls.
             Monty tugs on his leash and Doyle grunts and quiets down.




                                      YOUNG MAN 1

                            What up, Monty.



             Monty nods but doesn't say anything. He's studying the view.
             He stares at the green river, the steel bridges , the red
             tugboats, the stone lighthouse of Roosevelt Island.



             Doyle barks and Monty turns. SIMON, a bone-thin ma n in his
             early thirties, approaches them. He wears rubber boots that
             rise to his knees and a dirty yellow down parka .




                                      SIMON

                            Easy, Doyle, easy, buddy. What's up
                            there, Monty?
             Monty turns back to the river. Doyle barks again.

                                     SIMON (CONT'D)

                           You want to tell the dog to relax? Hey
                           there, Doyle. Good dog.






     0),^    Doyle has extended the leash as far as Monty will allow. He
     ~7     sniffs suspiciously at Simon.

                                     SIMON (CONT'D)

                           I don't think your dog likes me .

                                     MONTY

                           Go away, Simon.

                                      SIMON

                           I'm hungry here. Woke up an hour ago and
                           I was hungry.

                          Hundred and Tenth.




                                    SIMON

                          One Hundred and Tenth? Come on, I'm good.



            He reaches into his pocket and brings out a wad of five
            dollar bills held together by a rubber band.




                                     MONTY

                               (angry)
~,                        Put that away.



^V- ^       Doyle snarls. Simon repockets the money.







                                                                                      (CONTINUED)





 CONTINUED: (2)








                       SIMON

            Okay, okay. I'm just saying, I'm not
            looking for a mercy pop.

                     /


                       MONTY

            I'm over, man.
 Simon points at a line of scabs that run along his throat.

                     SIMON

           Cut myself shaving this morning -- four
           times. Can't keep my hands steady. Come
           on, Monty, help me out. I can't go to
           Harlem. Look at me--- they'll eat me alive
           up there.
Monty finally stands and walks toward the man, closer and
closer until their faces are inches apart.

                     MONTY

           You need to leave me alone, friend. I
           told you, I'm out of business.
Doyle sniffs Simon's boots, then raises his head, snout
climbing the man's leg. Simon dances a half-step, trying to
keep away from the pit bull without provoking him.




                     SIMON

          You worried about me narking you out? You
          know who I am.

                     MONTY

           You're not listening to me. I got
           touched. Game over.
Simon blinks, tries to JLaugh, looks behind him,,,looks down at
Doyle, rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

                    SIMON

          Five years I've been coming to you. All
          right, all right, I'm leaving. There's no
          need to be nasty.
Monty and Doyle watch the man go; they begin walking in the
opposite direction. They pass the concrete chessboards, the
sandboxes, and pause for a moment by a basketball court.
Six TEENS play -- with little skill -- one last game before
school. Monty shakes his head disdainfully, watching one
player dribble at the top of the key.

                    MONTY

          You got no left.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

 The player drives right and misses an open lay-up. Monty
 spits and continues walking, Doyle leading the way.

 EXT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL -- LATER

Monty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a
leafy street on the Upper East Side.
Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People
are always looking at Monty.
Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before
crushing them out and entering the school.

INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL

Monty walks down a corridor of the school building, Doyle
padding along beside him. STUDENTS, hurrying to their
classes, stare at the dog and then at Monty.
The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty.
Monty stops before a row of framed photographs. He examines
one photograph and smiles.

INSERT PHOTOGRAPH

The Campbell-Sawyer basketball team. The players stand in a
semi-circle with their coaches. We move in closer on one face
in particular: Monty, when he was sixteen, free and easy.
We move closer still and the black-and-white face begins to
blur.

                          ADMINISTRATOR (O.S.)

,,..   .... Excus.e-.me-,- sir, can I help_ you?

          .                                          


                                                      -       --

Monty, lost in a reverie, looks up. The ADMINISTRATOR, a
tall, harried-looking woman in her mid-fifties, squints at
him through her glasses.

                       MONTY

           What?

                     ADMINISTRATOR

           Can I help you with something?

                     MONTY

               (smiling)
           No, I don't think so.

                     ADMINISTRATOR

           There are no dogs allowed on school
           grounds.

                 dog.

      The administrator bends forward and squints at the photo.

                          ADMINISTRATOR

                I guess you weren't, the center.

                year. I still hold the all-time assist

      Monty stares at her. She shrugs.

                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)

      Monty turns back to the photo.

                Until I got kicked off the team. After
                that, they fell apart. Do you know where
                Jakob Elinsky is?

                          ADMINISTRATOR

                Probably in his classroom. Room 301.

      back.

                         I was there when he broke the record.
     Monty nods and continues on his way. The administrator
     watches man and dog walk down the long corridor.

     INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM

     JAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard, facing three rows of
     uninspired teenage faces. He wears a tweed jacket that seems
     a few sizes too large, with chalk stains on the sleeves.
     Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger. There is
     something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his
     lip.
    One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her
    desk, reading from a poetry textbook. Her eyes drown in pools
    of painted shadow, her hair is dyed black, tattooed roses
    garland her wrist.

                                MARY

                     "Let us roll all our strength and all
                     Our sweetness up into one ball,
                     And tear pur pleasures with rough strife,
                     Through the iron gates of life."
    Jakob watches her. We don't know the Campbell-Sawyer dress
    code, but we can guess that she's violating it . We can also
    guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly.
    Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt.

                                MARY (CONT'D)

                          (reading)
                     "Thus, though we cannot make our sun
                     Stand still, yet we will make him run."
    Mary shrugs and sits down.




                                                                 (CONTINUED)

           so. What do people think? What' s going on
           here?



Nobody says anything. Jakob nods .




                         JAKOB (CONT'D)

           Okay.



LUKE , a sullen-looking student with a shaved head and a
failed goatee, raises his hand.

                         JAKOB (CONT'D)

           Luke?

                     LUKE

           Can I go to the bathroom?

           No . You went twenty minutes ago .

                     LUKE

           I have a bladder infection.

                      MARY

           It's not real deep or anything. The guy
           wants to get laid and he's telling her to
           give it up .
A few of the students titter half-heartedly.



A knock on the door releases Jakob from his hell . He goes to
answer it and then "stops/ startled.                      ~"~
It's the type ofdoo r popular in school buildings> with a
wire-reinforced glass panel at head height , allowing you to
look into the classroom without disturbing anyone.



Doyle, tongue dangling from his mouth , stares back at Jakob
through the panel .

                    MARY (CONT'D)

          I didn't know your mother was coming
          today, Luke .

 down , getting his dirty paw s all over Jakob's jacket .

                       MONT Y

             Easy, Doyle.
 Doyle immediately calms down , squatting by Jakob' s feet and
 staring up at the teacher .

                        JAKOB

            Hey -- uh , what' s going on?
 Jakob seems awkward around Monty , nervous .

         look like me.

         No, I mean, he doesn't look like someone
         you'd be friends with.

       Vince Miskella writes a story about his
       grandmother dying and you give him an A?
       What is that, a charity A? Everyone's
       always writing about their grandmother
       dying. You know why? Not because it's so
       traumatic. Because it's a guaranteed A.
       And you're all sentimental, like, "Oh,
       Vince, that was very powerful, very
       moving." No it wasn't. You didn't care, I
       didn't care, nobody cared. That's what
       grandmothers do, they die.

                     MARY

           What? When I got what?




                      JAKOB

           The tattoo.

                     MARY

           She said, "Where'd you get the mone y for
           that. "

                       JAKOB

           Oh . And?

                    MARY

          And what did I say or where did I get the
          money?

                      JAKOB

           Well , what did you say, I guess .

                     MARY

           I said he did it for free.

                     JAKOB

          Oh . Did he?

                     MARY

          No . Why do you care so much?

                     JAKOB

          Just curious. __




                    MARY

          So you're not going to change the grade?




                     JAKOB

          No , I'm not changing the grade. I'd be
          happy to discuss --
Mary yanks her bookbag off the floor and straps it on her
shoulder.

           Forget it.
 She stomps out of the lounge, her black combat boots clomping
 on the corridor's linoleum floor.
Jakob shakes his head and looks up at the clock. 9:15. He
reaches for the phone sitting on the coffee table.

INT. SHREVE ZIMMER INVESTMENT BANK -- SAME TIME

FRANK SLATTERY, also in his mid-twenties, stares at the row
of clocks on the far wall. Below each clock is a sign: Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Frankfurt, London. The clock marked New York reads

9:15.

The trading floor is one giant room: rows of TRADERS seated
before their computers, jabbering into their telephone
headsets. No women -- the place is loud and aggressive.
Slattery is built like a former college wrestler: thick-
necked, broken-nosed, muscular, his hair retreating from his
forehead, his eyes undercast with dark crescents.
One of his phones rings. He answers.

               ----SEATTER Y          -   -   -

          Frank Slattery.
He listens for one second.

                    SLATTERY (CONT'D)

          Can't talk right now. Employment number's
          coming out.

He hangs up the phone and returns his gaze to the computer
screens in front of him. Clearly he's waiting for something
and clearly he's anxious.

                    LICHTER (O.S.)

          Coming out with us later on?
Slattery looks up at his boss, ARI LICHTER, early forties, a
plump, genial man.

                    SLATTERY

          Nah, I'm meeting some friends tonight.

                      LICHTER

          Big date?
The subject clearly makes Slattery uncomfortable.

                    SLATTERY

          More of a going-away party.

                    LICHTER

          Listen, the other thing, you're still
          holding onto all those contracts?

    .                SLATTERY

          Why, you're nervous?

                    LICHTER

          I don't like it. The claims numbers have
          dropped three weeks straight.

                     SLATTERY

          And everybody's thinking, if claims have
          dropped, employment must be up.

                    LICHTER

         Everybody's thinking that because it's
         pretty much always true.

                    SLATTERY

         Not this time.

                      LICHTER

                   SLATTERY

         I've got a theory.

                   LICHTER

         Oh good, you've got a theory. Look,
         you're in awfully deep. You've got sixty
         million of the bank's money in there--

               A hundred million.



    The news startles Lichter.




                          LICHTER

               A hundred million? Jesus, Frank.




                         SLATTERY

               They authorized me to a hundred million.



    Other traders sitting nearby have begun watching this
    exchange, and Lichter is careful to keep his voice down.

                        LICHTER

              A week ago. They raised your limit a week
              ago, and you're already maxing out.

                         SLATTERY

              I'm telling you, we're in for a low
              number. One-forty, maybe one-thirty-five.




                         LICHTER

              Cut your stake in half,    all right? You've
              been doing a great job,    everyone knows
              that, but I'm still you   r boss and I'm
              telling you: sell those    contracts.
    Lichter grips Slattery's shoulder for a moment and then walks
    toward his office (a real office, with walls and a door) ,
    exchanging hellos with other traders on the floor.
    PHELAN, fresh from college, walks down the row, handing fax
    sheets to all the traders. He hands a sheet to Slattery, wh o
    looks-at--it briefly before crumpling it .         ........

             everyone on their side of the fence.




                       PHELAN

         Slattery doesn't want to discuss this right now .

                               SLATTERY

                   More jobs means fewer people looking for
                   work, right? Which means it's harder to
                   find the right people for a job, which
                   means you got to raise wages to get them,
                   which mean s inflation goes up -- you

        MARCUSE peeks over the partition in front of Slattery. With
        his slicked-back hair , red suspenders, and obnoxious smirk,
        Marcuse looks like a ma n who owns the Gordon Gekk o action
        figure.

 Marcuse grins . He calls to another trader down the floor.




                      MARCUSE

           Hey , Schultz, what are we looking at for
           the employment number?.

           Two-fifty, two-seventy, somewhere in
           there .
 Marcuse sits down again, disappearing behind the partition.
 Slattery glowers at his desk. He picks up his phon e and holds
 the receiver to his ear, never dialing a number.
Lichter calls to Slattery from his office door.

                     LICHTER

           Slattery! We're good?
Slattery nods and gives a thumbs up. As soon as Lichter
returns to his office, Slattery hangs up the phone .
Marcuse sticks his head above the partition again.

                    MARCUSE

          contracts.-Looks like a huge numbe r o n -- ,---.----.

The trading floor suddenly -- and eerily-^ goes quiet.
Everyone's attention is fixed on the television monitors
hanging from th e ceilings. The monitors ar e muted; closed
captioning files along the bottoms of the screens.



Each monitor is tuned to the same station, a financial
network broadcasting the employment number's release. A
REPORTER wearing a bowtie reads the statistics.



Slattery bows hi s head. He holds his hands in his lap and
closes his eyes . For a long while the room is very quiet.



Then a commotion of shouts and groans riles the floor.
Everyone is hollering at the same time, and we can only make
out a few phrases .

           We're going for a ride!
Slattery looks up at the nearest monitor. A white number is
emblazoned on a blue background: 138,112. Every monitor in
the room flashes the same number.
Slattery stares at his computer screen. There it is again,
displayed prominently in the largest window: 138, 112.
Slattery raises his eyebrows. He juggles the crumpled fax
sheet a few times and then tosses it over the partition,
where Marcuse is sitting.

                     MARCUSE (O.S.)

           Fuck you, Slattery.
Slattery grins and leans back in his chair, hands behind his
head.

EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

A four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville.
NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps, reading a book.
Naturelle, in her early twenties, has the lean body of a
runner. It's cold outside but she doesn't seem to mind. When
she sees Monty coming she closes the book and stands.

                    NATURELLE

          How long have you guys been walking? I
          woke up at seven and you were already
          gone.                             _           _
Monty, digging in his pocket for his keys, kisses her for an
answer. Naturelle closes her eyes and tries to embrace him
but Monty abruptly ends the kiss and climbs the stairs.
Doyle wags the stump of his tail.

                     NATURELLE (CONT'D)

          How you doing, Mr. Doyle?
She bends down to scratch him behind his mangled ear.

      He holds the door open for her and Doyle.

      INT. MONTY'S APARTMENT

     Monty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle,
     then locks it. There are five locks and a heavy steel
     deadbolt.
     Despite the ominous security, it's a nice one-bedroom
     apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the
     brownstones across the street.
     Black-and-white photographs line the walls: shots of the
     Manhattan skyline, of Bensonhurst, of Doyle. The largest
     photo, hanging above the sofa, is of Brogan's Bar.
     Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep.
     Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the
     remote.

                         WEATHERMAN

               The first major storm of winter is
               heading our way --
     Monty turns off the television. He stares at the dead screen.
     Naturelle comes out of the kitchen carrying a jar of honey
     and a spoon.
     She hands the jar to Monty, who opens it for her. She sits
     beside him and begins eating" the honey, watching him. He sees
     her watching.

                          MONTY

               What?

                         NATURELLE

               What are you thinking about?

                         MONTY

               What am I thinking about?
    He leans forward and unclips a hand-tooled leather holster
    from the back of his belt. A "B" for Brogan is tooled into
    the leather, stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers' logo.
    A .40 caliber automatic, squat and black, rests in the
    holster. Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and
    runs his fingers over the B. Naturelle stares at the gun.

Naturelle hits him on the shoulder.

She leans forward and kisses him on the lips.

                    NATURELLE

          Come take a bath with me.

                    MONTY

          Not right now.
She caresses his jaw but Monty is distant, his mind                   J
elsewhere.                                                         ^--^

o    She sets the honey jar on the table and walks out of the
     living room. Monty listens to her in the bathroom, drawing
     the bathwater.
     He listens to the sound of running water.

                                                            CUT TO:


     INT. MONTY'S BATHROOM -- SIX MONTHS AGO

    Naturelle sits on Monty's lap in the narrow bathtub. He's
    massaging her shoulders. Music plays from a radio on the
    windowsill.
    She is laughing at something he just said. He leans closer
    and kisses the back of her neck, behind her ears. She
    stretches back, lifting one leg out of the bath.
    He runs his hand down her thigh and then stops, looking at
    the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on her ankle. She follows his
    gaze to the tattoo and then groans.

                        NATURELLE

              Not this again.

                        MONTY

              You were born in America, you lived in
              America your whole life, you've been to
              Puerto Rico twice, for vacation. What is
              that? I should get an Irish flag tattooed
              on my ass cause my grandparents are from
              there?

                        NATURELLE

              You,don!t have room on your ass for an
              Irish flag.
    Monty dips his hands into the warm water, reaches below her,
    grabs her butt. Naturelle shrieks and Monty laughs.

                        MONTY

              Between you and me the kids will be just
              right.
    Loud pounding on the apartment door startles them. They stare
    at each other. Doyle barks from the other room.
    Naturelle gets out of the tub, pulls on a bathrobe, and goes
    to answer the door. Monty waits, listening. He knows who it
    is. He stares out the bathroom's open window.




                                                                   25.











C)    INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM -- STILL IN FLASHBACK

     Monty, wearing sweatpants and no shirt, walks into the living
     room. Four D.E.A. AGENTS, all wearing D.E.A. windbreakers and
     shoulder holsters, wait for him.
     Doyle, ears back, growls at the agents. Monty scratches
     Doyle's head and the dog relaxes a bit.
     Naturelle, panicked, stares at Monty. She's still holding the
     apartment door open.

                           MONTY

                Close the door, baby.
     She closes the door.

                         AGENT BRZOWSKI

               Montgomery Brogan?

                            MONTY

               Yeah.
     Brzowski flips open a badge and hands a paper to Monty, who
     looks it over.

                         AGENT BRZOWSKI                                    ^^

               I'm Agent Brzowksi with the Drug
               Enforcement Agency. We've got a warrant
               to search your apartment.
     Brzowksi walks over to the sofa and sits down. The other
     three agents stroll around the apartment. One looks out the
     window; one starts flipping through a magazine on the coffee
     table; one stares at a photograph on the wall.

                         AGENT CUNNINGHAM

               You take this picture?

                         MONTY

               Yeah.

                         AGENT CUNNINGHAM

               Nice picture.
     When one of the agents steps too close to Doyle, the dog
     growls and the agent jumps back.

                         MONTY

               Easy, Doyle.

                         AGENT BRZOWSKI                                    I)

                   He's inside. He doesn't have to wear
                   tags.




                         AGENT BRZOWSKI

               He better stay calm or I'll have the
               pound come get him. I've seen too many
               men bit by these little bastards .
    Monty whistles and Doyle stands and walks over to him. Monty
    crouches, one hand stroking Doyle's thick neck.



    Naturelle, uncomfortable wearing only the bathrobe, begins
    heading back to the bedroom.

                          AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)

               Ms . Rosario? That's your name , right? I
               need you to stay right here, ma'am.



    He winks at her.

                         AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)

               Can't have you sneaking around.
    Naturelle leans against the wall, looking for a sign from
    Monty, who gives her none.
    The agents don't seem to be searching very hard.

                            AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)

               Hm.
    He stares down at the sofa he's sitting on .

                         AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT-?D)

               This sofa is not very comfortable.
    Monty stares at the agent for a second and then exhales. He
    turns and looks carefully at Naturelle.




                         AGENT CUNNINGHAM

              Maybe it's your posture. Posture's very
              important.




                         AGENT BRZOWSKI

              No , it's this sofa. It's very
              uncomfortable. It's lumpy.

                        MONTY

              Get it over with.

                   I just don't understand. It looks like
                   such a nice sofa. How much did you pay
                   for this sofa, Ms . Rosario?
         Brzowksi stands and looks down at the cushion. Monty is still
         staring at Naturelle, who meets his eye for a second and then
         quickly turns away.

                             AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)

                   Maybe it's the padding?

                             AGENT CUNNINGHAM

                   Could be the padding.
         Brzowski picks up the center cushion, turns it in his hands,
         and unzips it.

                             AGENT BRZOWSKI

                   Probably the padding.
        He pulls out handfuls of white fiber filling and lets them
        drift to the floor. Monty and Naturelle watch.

   ,                          AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)

rsS*f              Yeah, there's something lumpy in here,
 v-v              Mr. Brogan. It's a good thing I found
                    this, you know. It'll make your sofa much
                   more comfortable to sit on.
        The other agents laugh. Brzowski pulls out a package the size
        of a bottle of wine from the cushion, a bundle of plastic
        wrap and masking tape.
        Brzowski raises his eyebrows in mock shock while the other
        agents poh and. cluck*        -- --,      -- -~ -- ---

        INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM

        Monty sits on the sofa, running his hand over the sofa
        cushion. Outside it's dark and Monty hasn't turned on the
        lights.

                             NATURELLE (O.S.)

                  Baby?
V_/     Monty looks up. Naturelle stands in the bathroom's doorway,
        wearing a bathrobe.

 For a moment they watch each other in silence. Then he
 stands, grabs the holster off the table, and clips it to the
 back of his belt.




                      NATURELLE (CONT'D)

            Where you going?




                      MONTY

            I got to meet my dad for dinner. I'll
            call you in a couple hours.
He kisses her quickly and turns to go, but then stops and
looks at her.

                      MONTY (CONT'D)

            Could you wear the silver dress tonight?




                      NATURELLE

            You want me to?



He nods.

                      MONTY

            I want to remember you in that dress .
He walks out of the apartment, leaving Naturelle alone in the
dark living room.

EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING

Kostya sits on the top step of the stoop, sipping from a
silver flask. A female JOGGER runs past and Kostya calls
after her.

                           KOSTYA

         Hello ,--teeauti-f-uA~ woman!

           -

She doesn't look in his direction. He takes another swig from
his flask.
A young MOTHER pushes a baby stroller past the stoop.




                     KOSTYA (CONT'D)

           Hello, beautiful mother! Hello, little
           baby!
The mother doesn't look at him, but the two-year old GIRL,
fascinated, stares at him.




                      KOSTYA (CONT'D)

                (calling after mother)
           You look like Julia Roberts. They tell
           you this, yes? Come back! I make you a
           new baby. I make you a boy!

Monty opens the front door. He stares down at Kostya.

                     MONTY

           What are you doing here?

                     KOSTYA

           So many beautiful women, this
           neighborhood. I like very much.
Kostya stands and grips Monty's arm.

                     KOSTYA (CONT'D)

           You are okay?

                      MONTY

           I'm having the time of my life.

                     KOSTYA

           Uncle Blue wants me talking with you. He
           wants you coming to Velvet tonight.

                     MONTY

           Yeah, three other people already told me .
           He's really dying to say goodbye, huh?
Kostya releases Monty's arm and nods sadly.

                       KOSTYA

           It seems.

                    MONTY

          What does he want?

                    KOSTYA

          I don't know.

                    KOSTYA

          Yes, I heard, but you don't return my
          calls. And Uncle wants to make sure.

                    MONTY

          I'll be there. I'm bringing Naturelle and
          some friends.

 Kostya shrugs.




                      KOSTYA

            We have this conversation one time,
            remember? You get angry.

                      MONTY

           Oh , Jesus. She didn't dime me out, man .




                        KOSTYA

           No?




                     MONTY

           Why would she?



 Kostya shrugs again.

                     KOSTYA

           Maybe her aunt is illegal alien.

                     MONTY

           What if she is?

                     KOSTYA

           Maybe the Federals threaten her.
Monty shakes his head and walks down the stairs.

                     MONTY

  .        You're insane. She wouldn't do that.

                    KOSTYA

          No? Did you ask her?
Monty--stares--up--at- Kostya for a few seconds before-walking --
away.
Kostya stands at the top of the stoop. He feels something and
raises his palms to the air. The snow has begun to fall.



He looks up into the sky. Something catches his eye -- in one
of the fourth floor windows, Naturelle is staring down at
him.
Kostya watches her. She lets the curtain close. Kostya takes
another slug from his flask.




INT. SUBWAY STATION




Monty waits for the 6 train. Two BOYS (12), wearing winter
parkas and knit caps, crouch near the edge of the platform,
pointing down at the tracks and laughing.

                     MONTY

           What's down there?
 The boys point and Monty looks. We follow his gaze. We can't
 see anything at first, but then, as if our eyes were
 adjusting to the dark, we begin to pick out movement.
A gang of large RATS crawls through the tracks, nosing
through balled-up paper bags, candy wrappers and orange
peels.

                      BOY 1

           These ones, they eat rat poison like
           chocolate.
The biggest rat of all sniffs around the base of an upright
wax-paper coffee cup that sits just outside the third rail.
Monty reaches into the pocket of his camel's hair coat and
pulls out a handful of change.

                    MONTY

          Watch this.
He selects a quarter and -- with a free throw motion as smooth
as Hersey Hawkins's-- tosses it into the empty cup, a ten-
foot shot.
The big rat, startled, hustles into the alcove below the lip
of the platform. The boys, impressed, whistle.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

          Here --
He offers his palmful of change.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          Take a shot at it.
The boys look at each other for a moment before each takes a
coin. They stare up at Monty. He nods at them.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          Let's see what you got.
Boy 1 takes careful aim at the coffee cup. His shot is way
off target, though -- it pings off the tile on the far side of
the tunnel.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          Your release is too high. Look --
He mimics the boy's shooting motion.

                Soccer? All right, forget it.
                     (turning to the other boy)
                Your turn, little man .
     Boy 2 toes the edge of the yellow danger line and practices
     his motion . When he finally releases the coin, it flashes
     through the air and drops neatly into the cup.

                            MONTY (CONT'D)

                Thataboy!
     He raises his fist and the boy taps knuckles, grinning




                         BOY 1

               You see that! You see that! Charlie got
               mad skills!
     Charlie says nothing, just grins and hops around on one foot.




                         MONTY

               Make a wish.




                         CHARLIE

               I get a wish?

                           MONTY               '

               Hell , yes . A shot like that deserves a
               wish.



     Monty and Charlie stare at the coffee cup and concentrate.




                                                                      33

            see you there, I hope? June fifteenth?
 The train has pulled into the station and Monty moves toward
 the doors.

                     MONTY

           Yeah, I hope so, definitely. Good seeing
           you.
 Monty makes his escape and Trey watches him go.

                     NANCY

           He went to Campbell-Sawyer?

                     TREY

           Mm. Well, he was a scholarship kid. It
           didn't take, though. They threw him out
           junior year.
Through the subway car windows, they watch Monty jogging up
the stairs.

                       NANCY

           For what?

                     TREY

          Selling drugs.

          You can take the kid out of Bensonhurst,
          but you can't take the Bensonhurst out of
          the kid.

EXT. BROGAN'S BAR -- NIGHT

The snow is falling faster. We watch the flakes spin through
a yellow cone of streetlight.
We see the bar from the street.. The name "Brogan's Bar &
Grill" is written in gold script on the storefront window.
From the outside it looks like any other Bensonhurst bar,
neon beer signs hanging in the window.

INT. BROGAN'S BAR

On the inside, though, it's clear that attention has been
paid to every detail. Everything is right: the zinc bartop,
the brass foot-rail, the antique mirrors behind the liquor.

 A BARTENDER wipes down the bartop with a rag and a spray-
 bottle . Two CUSTOMERS sit on stools and watc h the basketball
 game on television.
 Mont y sits at a corner table with his father, JAME S BROGAN ,
 fifty. Each ma n has a pint of Guinness. The olde r Broga n was
 clearly a fine-looking ma n in his day, but the year s hav e
 bee n hard on him.
 Monty points at the Tiffany-glass sconces on the wall .

                         MONT Y

               Where'd you find those?

                      MR . BROGAN

           Estate sale in Sheepshead Bay. Old lady
           dies and her kids sell everything five
           days later. The china -- she probably
           thought her great-grandkids would be
           eating off those plates.

                     MONT Y

           Maybe they didn't need any more plates .

                     MR . BROGAN

               (wistfully)
           It was beautiful china.
Monty leans back in his chair and surveys the place . No t that
he hasn't seen the bar a thousand times -- he' s havin g a hard
time looking directly at his father.
RUTH (60), a waitress with a face like a crumpled pape r bag,
arrives with the food: pork chops for the elder Brogan , a
steak for Monty.

                     MONT Y

           Thanks, Ruth .

                     RUTH

           Anytime, sweetie .
She rests her hand on Monty's shoulder for a moment .

                    RUTH (CONT'D)

          I'll send you cookies every month . Peanut                   I
          butter, right? Your favorite.
Monty smiles and nods . Ruth exchanges glances wit h Mr . Brogan
before departing. Mr . Brogan breaks a bread roll an d butters
it . He stares at the buttered bread and leaves it on his
plate .                                                               \j

            Ah , come on, Dad.




                      MR. BROGAN

            See if he can help with anything.




                      MONTY

            Sal? The guy's been out of the picture
            for twenty years.

                      MR. BROGAN

            He might know some people in there .

            The guy's three hundred years old. He
            sits around playing gin rummy all day.
            What's he going to do for me?

                      MR. BROGAN

            He still knows people.

                       MONTY

           Dad, would you please? I'll be all right.
           Just, please, don't get involved in this .

           You're still going to be a young man when
           you get out.



- Monty lets his fork drop and wipes his mouth with his napkin.

                      MR. BROGAN (CONT'D)

           I know you don't think so. But listen to
           me . You keep your head down in there.
           Don't start any trouble.

           Jesus. Enough.



 Both men stare at the uneaten food on their plates .




                     MR. BROGAN

           This should never have happened.



 Monty raps the tabletop with his knuckles.

INT. BROGAN'S BATHROOM -- LATER

Monty stands in the cramped bathroom, staring into the
mirror. Someone has scrawled "Fuck you" in magic marker on
the wall above the mirror.

                                                          CUT TO:

Monty stares into the mirror covering one wall of the room.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Two agents stare back at him through the one-way glass.

INT. DEA DIVISION OFFICE, INTERROGATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Monty.sits at the table and waits. Agent Brzowksi walks in,
followed by Agent Cunningham. Brzowski leaves the door ajar
for a moment.
Monty looks through the door and sees Naturelle leaving
another room, escorted by two agents. She makes eye contact
with Monty. Brzowski shuts the door. He smiles at Monty.

                    AGENT BRZOWSKI

          Good looking girl you got there.
Monty glares at him. Brzowski pretends to sh,iver.



          Ooh, that's a scary look. Yikes. You see
          the look he gave me?
Cunningham laughs. Both agents take seats at the table.

                    AGENT BRZOWSKI (CONT'D)

          Naturelle Rosario. What a name. You see
          the body on that girl?
Cunningham laughs again.

                    MONTY

          You fucking touch her --

         No, no, you've got it all wrong. She

Monty is silent for a few seconds. When he does speak, his
tone is very quiet and deliberate -- he is trying to restrain
his temper.

                    MONTY

          You're lying to me .




                     AGENT BRZOWSKI

          All I know is, she's walking away. We
          just signed her release. Bye bye ,
          Naturelle.




                    AGENT CUNNINGHAM

          She's probably having a big party
          tonight.

                    AGENT BRZOWSKI

          Sure, why not? Big celebration. She's got
          that whole big apartment to herself now.

          She's a smart girl. You on the other
          hand...

                    AGENT BRZOWSKI

          You're supposed to be smart. Got yourself
          a scholarship to a fancy private school,
          huh? Not bad for a kid from Bensonhurst.




                   AGENT CUNNINGHAM

         And then you get yourself thrown out for
         dealing. Pretty dumb, buddy.

      door. Monty rubs harder. It's not coming out.
VZ7   Another knock.

     jacket.

                          MONTY

                The morning? What for? I'm taking a bus
                up there.

               Forget the bus. I'll drive you. It'll
               take half as long.
     Monty frowns, backing his chair away from the table.

               No thanks. I'd rather say goodbye here.
     Mr . Brogan pulls a small photograph from his wallet and hands
     it to his son.

     INT. ELEUTHERIA GREEK RESTAURANT -- NIGHT




     UNCLE BLUE, SENKA VALGHOBEK, and VICTOR GEDNY sit on the
     private balcony that overlooks the restaurant's mai n room.



     The place is furnished in classic Outer Borough Greek
     fashion: whitewashed walls , clay-tiled floors, poster s of the
     Parthenon at dawn and Santorini at sunset.



    Uncle Blue owns the place . He's a fierce-looking ma n with a
    thick black beard, powerful hands, and no tolerance for
    incompetence. It's hard to determine his age -- anywhere from
    forty to sixty.
    Valghobek, his lieutenant, looks at first glance like an
    overweight suburban dad. But on closer inspection there is
    something absolutely mirthless in his smile, a meannes s
    around his eyes. He's in his late forties.
    Gedny, mid-thirties, Uncle Blue's lawyer, wears a shiny suit,
    a gold bracelet, and a deep , artificial-looking tan .
    Gedny busily eats his shrimp and feta while the other two
    watch him. Gedny gestures toward the windows.

                        GEDNY

              Starting to snow.

                         UNCLE BLUE

              You met with Brogan this morning.            -
    Uncle Blue's accent, like his age, is difficult to pi n down.
    He could be Afghani or Iranian or Turkish.




                        GEDNY

              I did, yeah.



    Gedny reaches for his wine , takes a sip.




                         UNCLE BLUE

              And?




                          GEDNY

              He' s no t lovin g lif e righ t now,

    Gedny laughs but quickly notices that Uncle Blue and
    Valghobek are not amused.

                         GEDNY

              Listen, they found six hundred     and fifty
              g's in your boy's sofa cushion.     They got
              every white junkie on the East     Side
              saying Brogan's the sell. Game     over.



    Uncle Blue and Valghobek say nothing. Gedny licks his lips

                         GEDNY (CONT'D)

              It's U.S . Code. There's nothing to argue.
              Who do I argue with, the fucking grid?
              It's seventy-eight to ninety-seven
              months, automatic. I kept him out of
              stepback* kep_t him in the world for a few
              extra months --

                         UNCLE BLUE

              The judge kept him out of stepback. Why?
              If he's not talking with the Federals,
              how come he's still on the street?



    Gedny shrugs.

                        GEDNY

             It's pretty common for non-violent
             offenders. He's a white boy with no
             record and his father put up his bar as
             the bail bond. They're not worried about
             him jumping.

            They know more than you think. If
            Brogan's telling the truth, he was
            touched. The DEA went straight to his
            sofa. They knew exactly where it was.

                      GEDNY

            Someone dimed him out. You know who?
 Uncle Blue and Valghobek watch the lawyer, impassive and
 silent.

                     GEDNY (CONT'D)

           None of my business.

                      UNCLE BLUE

           Correct.

 EXT. MULBERRY STREET -- NIGHT

Monty walks down the snow-covered street, hands in the
pockets of his camel's hair coat. He watches everything
intently: the passersby, the cars swerving through the slush,
the stores and restaurants.

EXT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE

He stops in front of a fashionable shop. Beyond the plate
glass window, bald mannequins wear the latest styles.

window, peers out and sees Monty. He goes to the door,
unlocks it, holds it open for Naturelle and Monty.

 EXT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE WINDOW -- NIGHT

 Monty, still remembering, stares through the window. His
 reflection stares back at him.

 INT. SLATTERY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

 Slattery opens the door and Jakob hurries in, his Yankees hat
 (which he wears for the rest of the night) and coat dusted
 with snow.

                     SLATTERY

           It's really coming down, huh?
Slattery lives in a Young Man with Money without Woman
Apartment. The television set in the living room is so large
that the weatherman startles Jakob.
The living room itself is bigger than many Manhattan
apartments, but it's empty except for the television, an old
sofa, a coffee table, a Persian rug (still rolled) under the
windows, and a shiny red electric guitar in the corner.
Slattery returns to the sofa, bottle of beer in hand, while
Jakob remains standing, brushing the snow from his coat.

                    JAKOB                                              ^

           Do you think real human beings use the
           word "doozy"?

                     SLATTERY

           Ten inches of snow!

                     JAKOB

           Maybe we'll have a snow day tomorrow.

                      SLATTERY

           We should go skiing this weekend. I
           bought some racing skis. Six hundred
           bucks.for a pair of fucking skis .

                     JAKOB

           I don't know how to ski.

                      SLATTERY

          Well so what. Neither do I. But ten
          inches!
               (beat)                                               !
          You gonna stand all night? You'r e making                 !
          me nervous.
Jakob sits beside Slattery and stares unhappily at the huge
television. When the screen goes blank befor e a commercial,         \
he sees his own face reflected in the glass .                       j|

                      JAKOB                                         !

          Frank?

                      SLATTERY

          Yeah?

                    JAKOB

          Are you ready for this?
Slattery changes channels.

                      SLATTERY

          For what?

                    JAKOB

          For tonight.

                    SLATTERY

          What's there to be ready for?

                   JAKOB

         What do we say to him? He's goin g to be
         living in a cell for seven years .

                     JAKOB (CONT'D)

           It's like visiting a friend in the                       -
           hospital with cancer . What do we say?




                     SLATTERY

           We don't say anything. We get him drunk
           and go wherever he wants to go .

                     JAKOB

           I don't even know wh y he invited me .




                     SLATTERY

           What are you talking about?




                     JAKOB

           We hardly ever see each other these days .
           You and I are his friends from the past .




                     SLATTERY

           His friends from the present haven't done
           him much good.
They're quiet for a time, staring at the huge television.

                     JAKOB

           I can't believe he'l l be gone for seven
           years. Someone turns him in and boom,
           goodbye.

                    SLATTERY

          It's the best thing that ever happened to
          him.
The comment startles Jakob.

                    JAKOB

          What does that mean ?




                     SLATTERY

          It means if he didn't get arrested, he
          wouldn't be alive in seven years . They'd
          find him under the Manhattan Bridge with
          two bullets in hi s head.
Jakob thinks about this for a second before picking up a
framed photograph from the coffee table.

 Slattery grunts. Jakob continues to stare at the photograph .

 INT.   CAMPBELL-SAWYER CAFETERIA -- FLASHBACK




The three boys, age sixteen, sit at a table with their trays
of food. They wear the school uniform: blazers with the
Campbell-Sawyer crest, loosely knotted ties.



Young Slattery picks up a strand of limp spaghetti from his
plate .

                        YOUNG SLATTERY

              Watch this.



He sticks one end up one nostril while his friends stare at
him.
Slattery snorts and then blows his nose. Monty and Jakob back
away in disgust. Slattery sticks a finger into his other
nostril and pulls down the end of the spaghetti strand.
One end of the spaghetti strand now dangles from each
nostril. He pulls on each end, a little this way, a little
that way.

                        YOUNG SLATTERY (CONT'D)

              It's called brain flossing.

                        YOUNG MONTY

              This is why you're still a virgin.

                        YOUNG SLATTERY

              I'm not a virgin.
Two classmates, TREY and MASON, come over to their table .
Both are blonde, WASPy, and lazily elegant.




                        TREY

              That's attractive, Slattery.




                        MASON

              Very classy. Here they are , the three
              Lords of the Outer Boroughs.



Slattery glares at them, the spaghetti still dangling from
his nose .

                          YOUNG SLATTERY

              Fuck you.

           Ooh, good comeback. Come on, we expect
           our scholarship boys to be a little
           quicker than that.

                      YOUNG SLATTERY

                (clenching his fists)
           You want to see how quick I am?

                     MASON

           All right, all right, take it easy. What
           are you boys up to this weekend?

                     YOUNG JAKOB

           We've got that Paradise Lost paper due
           Monday.
Trey rolls his eyes.

                    TREY

          Monty, you coming to my party?

                    YOUNG MONTY

          I don't know, maybe.



          It's gonna be a rager.

                    YOUNG SLATTERY

          A Park Avenue rager? You're gonna sit
          around drinking tea?
Slattery drinks from his milk carton, letting his pinkie
finger dangle in imitation of an aristocrat drinking tea

                    TREY            ,,.    ...

          Smoking tea, more like. I'm buying half
          an ounce in the Meadow later on.
Mason mimics smoking a J.

                    MASON

          Two hundred bucks, going up in smoke.

                    YOUNG MONTY

          Two hundred bucks for half an ounce?

                    TREY

          Why, how much does it cost you?
Monty shrugs

              I could get it for seventy.



  Trey pull s out his calfskin wallet and selects a crisp
  hundred dollar bill . He hands it to Monty.

                       TREY

             You get it, you can keep the change.



 Trey and Mason amble away. Monty snaps the bill between hi s
 fingers. Jakob looks at Monty skeptically.

                       YOUNG JAKOB

             Since when are you the big player?

                        YOUN   G MONTY

                  (gesturing    at Trey and Mason)
             They were born     with money, right? Okay,
             fair enough. I     was born with sway.

                       YOUNG JAKOB

             What's sway?
 Monty leans toward the next table over, where four GEEKISH
 STUDENTS are poring over their textbooks.

                      YOUNG MONTY

            Hey, Julian. How's that math homework
            treating you?
 JULIAN, a pale, pudgy boy with an odd resemblance to Alfred
 Hitchcock, grins at Monty and shrugs. He's clearly flattered
 by Monty's attention; his three friends stare at Monty.

            Piece of cake. Want to borrow it?

Julian laughs and hands Monty a sheet of graph paper covered
with geometric proofs .




                       JULIAN

            Try no t to copy my name this time.

       He grabs for the spaghetti strand dangling from Slattery's
       nose. Slattery defends himself with a butter knife.

                                                                        CUT TO:


       INT. SLATTERY'S APARTMENT

       Jakob returns the photograph to the coffee table.

                            JAKOB

                  Lords of the Outer Boroughs. Remember
                  that?
       Slattery stands and stretches. He looks tired.

                             SLATTERY

                  You want to help me with this rug? It's
                  been sitting here for a month.

                            JAKOB

                  Where do you want it?

                               SLATTERY

                  Over here.
       They carry the rolled rug to the center of the room and tear
       off the plastic wrap.

                           JAKOB

                 What's he planning to do with Doyle?

                            SLATTERY

                 Doyle? I don't know. Give him to
                 Naturelle?
       Slattery balls up the plastic wrap and tosses it into the
       corner. They begin unrolling the rug.

                           JAKOB

                 They should at least let him take his dog
                 with him. Maybe it wouldn't be so lonely.
       Slattery cocks an eyebrow and stares at Jakob.

                           SLATTERY

                 You can't take your dog to prison with
                 you.




                                                                   (CONTINUED)

               I'm just saying it would be nice if you
               could.



They look down at the unrolled rug.




                     SLATTERY

           That looks pretty good^

                     JAKOB

           Monty's tough. I think he'll be okay.



Slattery starts shaking his head and Jakob hurriedly
continues.

                     JAKOB (CONT'D)

           If it was me , I'd never last a day. But
           Monty's different.

                      SLATTERY

                (dismissively)
           You don't get it. Here, let's move it
           closer to the sofa.
They lift the rug and shift it a few feet.

                     JAKOB

           So explain it to me .

                     SLATTERY

           You want the simple version? People wh o
           look like Monty don't do wel l in prison .




                     JAKOB

          You're talking about... It can't be as
          bad as people say. I mean, it's a Federal
          prison. I'm sure they're pretty careful --



Slattery starts to laugh.

                     SLATTERY

          Man , you talk exactly like a guy who
          never left school.



Jakob has no comeback for this . He simmers.




                     SLATTERY (CONT'D)

          Monty's got three choices, and none of
          them are good. One , he can run. Get on a
          train going to wherever and hope they
          never catch up to him.

           I'm not saying what he will do, I'm
           saying what his choices are. Number two --
 Slattery makes a gun with his thumb and index finger and
 points it at his temple. Jakob's eyes go wide.

                     JAKOB

           Kill himself? Not a chance. No way.
           What's the third choice?

                     SLATTERY

           The third choice?
Slattery thinks about it for a minute.

                     SLATTERY (CONT'D)

           The third choice is he goes to prison.

                      JAKOB

           That's what's going to happen. He'll go
           and he'll make it through.

                    SLATTERY

          Maybe. But no matter what, it's bye-bye
          Monty.

                    JAKOB

          What does that mean?
Slattery raises his thumb.

                    SLATTERY

          If he runs, he's gone. And he won't be
          coming home.
He raises his index finger.

                    SLATTERY (CONT'D)

          If he pulls the trigger, he's gone.
          They'll keep the casket closed.
He raises his middle finger.

                     SLATTERY (COM" D)

          If they lock him away, he's gone. You'll
          never see him again.

                there and I'll see him when he gets out.

                          SLATTERY

               I wouldn't bet on it. You think you're
               still gonna be friends? You think you'll
               kick back with a couple beers and

     INT. MONTY'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     Naturelle, wearing the sleek, shimmering silver dress, enters
     the kitchen. She's looking for something.
     She finds her keys by the cutting board, and then stops for a
     moment, looking at the carving knife atop the clean cutting
     board.

    Naturelle, wearing shorts and a t-shirt, slices onions while
    music plays on the stereo. We hear the apartment door open
    and close, and then Monty comes into the kitchen.
    Naturelle continues slicing onions. Monty walks over to her
    and embraces her from behind. He kisses her neck, her ears.

                        NATURELLE

              Do anything special?

                           MONTY

              Nope.

                        NATURELLE

              Anyone call for me when I was out?

                          MONTY

              Nah.

                          NATURELLE

              Nobody?
    Monty begins to get worried.

           Urn. .. I don't --
Naturelle wheels around and Monty has to jump back to avoid
getting gutted by the carving knife.

                     NATURELLE

           Like, for example, my mother didn't call?

                     MONTY

           Oh, shit. Shit, I'm sorry. I completely--
Naturelle stabs the air to emphasize her point.

                    NATURELLE

          This is the third time this month,
          Montgomery. What's your problem, you're
          illiterate? You can't write down a
          message on a piece of paper?

                     MONTY

           I meant to.y I just --

                    NATURELLE

          You meant to? You meant to?

                    MONTY

          Could you put the knife away?

                    NATURELLE

          I'll put the knife away. You want me to
          put the knife away?

                    MONTY

              (smiling)
          Okay --                                          ^

                    NATURELLE

          This is funny?
Monty steps back and Naturelle advances on him with the
knife. She's kidding, basically, but it's hard to tell.

                    NATURELLE (CONT'D)

          You think this is funny? I'll carve your
          heart out, you shit.
Monty laughs. Doyle has walked into the kitchen and now
stands behind Monty, staring up curiously at the two humans.
                    MONTY                                           x

 Naturelle waves the knife at him and Monty takes another step
 backward, trips over Doyle, and lands hard on his back . He
 begins to laugh hysterically.




                      NATURELLE

            Keep laughing.



 She kicks him in the ribs, not very hard, and Mont y howl s
 with laughter. Doyle, a little confused, licks Monty' s face.

                     NATURELLE (CONT'D)

           Yeah, keep laughing, you fuck. I'll carve
           your heart out and feed it to Doyle.
She continues kicking while Monty laughs and Doyle,
mystified, begins to bark, and finally Naturelle starts
laughing too.
Monty grabs her wrist and pulls her down on top of him . She
drops the knife to the side and bites Monty, hard, oh the
lips.

                                                             CUT TO :





INT. MONTY'S KITCHEN -- PRESENT

Naturelle, in her silver dress, stares at the carving knife.
Doyle pads in behind her, panting. Naturelle turns and looks
down at his blunt, expectant face.

           You ready for this?

           Al l right, that's what he wants . It's his
           place. If someone had asked, I'd have
           said do this party some other night .
           Tonight's gonna be insane. This DJ we've
           got playing, he's like Jesus these days .
           Every high school kid in the five

Kostya frowns at the smaller man .

          Monty goes to prison tomorrow. You wan t
          we have party tomorrow night?




                     VOLANDES

               (holding up his hands)
          Hey, I like Monty. He's a good kid. Okay,
          any special requests for this party?



Volandes taps the side of his nose. Kostya shakes his head

                    KOSTYA

          None of that. For his last night , we get
          him a girl.

                    VOLANDES

          What does he like?



Kostya smiles.

                    KOSTYA

          Monty? He likes everything. Get him a
          pretty girl. And don't be cheap.
The office door opens. Uncle Blue and Valghobek walk in.
Volandes quickly stands.

                    VOLANDES

          Hey. I didn't -- we weren't expecting you.

 INT. BUG BAR -- NIGHT

 Slatter.y. and Jakob sit on bar stools. Slattery sips from a
 glass of whiskey; Jakob nurses a bottle of beer.
 The Bug Bar gets its name from the exotic insects in glass
 jars behind the bar. A television above the bar shows the
 entertainment news.
A VETERAN in an army jacket practices trick shots on the pool
table, JODY, the young, zaftig bartender, runs a rag over the
bartop.

                         JODY

              How you doing, Frank? You want another
              one?

Jody walks away. Slattery and Jakob examine her tush.

           A student, yeah. A junior. What's weird
           is, I mean this girl is sixteen. Maybe
           seventeen, I don't know. She's not really
           pretty -- not in the usual way, but she's --
           I don't know, she's got something.

           Uh-huh.

                     JAKOB

          I told him -- I told Terry he ought to
          just forget about it, put her out of his
          mind, but he's -- he's kind of obsessing.
          It's a little scary, the way he talks
          about it. He's like, ^Five years from
          now, she'll be almost out of college. And
          I'll be thirty-one. Nothing wrong with
          that.'                                                             r~\
Slattery sips from his whiskey. He still hasn't looked at
Jakob.

                    SLATTERY

          You haven't fucked her yet, have you?
Jakob's eyes go wide.

           See, wait a second. If you were listening

Slattery turns and appraises Jakob.

                    SLATTERY

          You haven't fucked her, right?
Jakob starts to protest and Slattery raises his eyebrows.

                     JAKOB

          No.

                    SLATTERY

 Jakob angrily picks at the label of his beer bottle.




                     JAKOB

           I'm not a pervert or anything.



 Slattery drains his whiskey. He tries to catch Jody's eye ,
 but she's staring at someone who just walked into the bar .



Slattery and Jakob see Monty in the mirror. For a momen t
neither of them moves .
Then both of them force cheerful expressions onto their
faces. They rise and each embraces Monty in turn.

                     MONTY

           You been here long?

                     JAKOB

           Oh, we got here early.

                     MONTY

           Uncle Blue's throwing me a party at
           VelVet. We ought to head over there.

                     JAKOB

           Whose Uncle is he?

                     MONTY

           Huh? Nah, it's a nickname. His real
           name's like Ankaybusim or something, but
           no one can pronounce it .
Monty surveys the sawdust-covered floor, the country rtiusic-

          Frank wants to be a redneck. He comes
          here and whistles Dixie while he's
          peeing.



Jody lines up three shot-glasses of whiskey.

          It's nasty outside. You fellas gotta warm

           screen. I have a second cousin playing
           for the Packers .



 Slattery rubs the calluses on his palm and Jakob stares at
 the floor. Jody laughs at their morose reaction.




                      JODY (CONT'D)

           You don't have to come! I was just

Monty raises his glass and Slattery and Jakob grab their
glasses and raise them too .

                     MONTY

           Fuck Sunday.
He drinks. Slattery and Jakob hesitate and then follow suit .




EXT . VELVET -- NIGHT

Monty steps out of a taxi, followed by Slattery and Jakob . A
roiling MOB occupies half the block, crowding in front of the
entrance to the dance club .
Most are teenagers. They clot together in groups of fours and
fives, smoking cigarettes and stomping their feet to keep
warm. Almost none are dressed for the snow.

                    MONTY

          The whole city came out to say goodbye .

          Wait a second.



Monty slips through the maz e of boys and girls . The kids look
at him as he walks by .



Monty makes his way to the velvet ropes . KHARI GREENE , a
pillar of a ma n wearing the exact same camel's hair coat as
Monty, stands by the door, checking names off a clipboard.



Two pale scars run in parallel lines down Khari's left cheek.




                     MONTY (CONT'D)

Mary clutches Jakob's arm and rests her head on his chest.

Jakob disengages himself from Mary. She beams at him. They
follow Monty to the side door and disappear inside.

INT. VELVET -- MOMENTS LATER

Monty walks up the back staircase (marked Club Employees

stunned.

                    MARY

              (to Monty)
          So how do you know Jake?

        Monty pushes open the door at the stop of the staircase. The
        noise rushes in, overwhelmingly loud, the bass vibrating in
        our bones.
        Mary opens her mouth and speaks, but we might not be able to
        hear it over the music.

                                MARY

                   Truth.

        INT. VELVET VIP ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

        Monty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room. Naturelle is
        already there, speaking with Slattery.
        The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red
        velvet. The couches are upholstered in red velvet, the small
        bar in the corner is draped with red velvet, the carpet is
        red faux velvet.
----^   DJ Dusk's music pours from speakers bolted into the corners.
s
        His beats are impossible to sit still for, incorporating
        elements of bossa nova, techno, hip hop, and jazz.
        Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle. His
        gaze tends to slide her way, and his desire for her is
        apparent to everyone.
        Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him. She
        looks beautiful in-the silver dr.ess_...-_Sh .hugs him. Monty

        When she realizes he's not returning the hug, she quickly
        releases him. He's watching her carefully. She sees Jakob and
        smiles at him.

    Mary grins, tears off her fake fur coat, and hides it
    underneath a sofa. She wears a white tank-top with Tweety
    Bird emblazoned on the front. Tweety Bird looks scared.



    DAPHNE, a young waitress in a green dress , comes over with a
    tray of champagne flutes. Naturelle kisses Daphne on the
    cheek and the two women exchange greetings. Everyone takes a
    glass.

              Champagne for my real friends, real pain

    Everyone takes a sip except for Mary, who guzzles hers in one
    giant gulp, then belches and wipes her mouth with the back of
    her hand. Jakob stares at her, horrified.

                        MARY

              Anyone want to go dance?



    Naturelle glances at Monty.

 Daphne sets a champagne bottle in an ice bucket on the table,
 then retreats to the small bar in the corner of the room.
 Monty sits on the red velvet sofa and Jakob lies down next to
 him, covering his eyes with his arm.

           He needs a home. And he loves you.

                    JAKOB

          Yeah, but... I don't know. You've seen
          the size of my apartment.

                    MONTY

          Poor Doyle, he'll live in a small
          apartment. Hey, he's a tough dog. He'll
          survive.

                    JAKOB

          What about Nat?

                    MONTY

          She's moving in with her mom. Woman hates
          him. And Doyle hates Frank. And my Dad's
          allergic.

                    JAKOB

          The thing is --
Monty takes another sip and then holds the champagne flute up
to the light.

                    MONTY

          Cristal. They went all out for me , huh?
          I'm lucky to work for such caring people.

                    JAKOB

          One more glass of this and I'm officially
          drunk.

                    MONTY

          Listen, this is important to me.. Doyle is
          important to me . You understand that?




                   JAKOB

         Yeah, of course.

                    MONTY

         Doyle's the toughest guy I know. He was
         lying there off the highway when I found
         him, waiting to die. He knew he was going
         to die. And he didn't make a sound. The
         best thing I ever did, my whole life, was
         rescue that black little son-of-a-bitch.
         Every day he's had since then is because
         of me . Every time he runs through the
         park, that's me . Every bone he chews --
         because of me . I saved him.

            And it's different from what you'd
            expect, right? I saved him but I'm the
            one that's grateful. Because I see him
            running around, I hear him barking, and
            there he is, the best thing I ever did,
            in the flesh.
                 (beat)
           I'm not going to let the pound have him.
           Doyle's the ugliest fucking dog in the
           five boroughs. Who's gonna adopt him? And
           I'm telling you now, I will not let a vet
           stick a needle in him and end him. I
           saved his life, right? I'm responsible
           for him. I didn't go through all that
           just so some vet can put hi m to sleep. If
           it comes to that, I'll do it myself. I'll
           put a bullet in his ear tonight. So I'm
           asking you, Jake -- for me , as a favor for
           me , and it's a big favor but I'm asking
           you -- will you take him? Will you take
           him home with you?
Jakob is quiet, rubbing his palms over the red velvet sofa
cushions.

                    JAKOB

          You know what? It would be an honor.

                    MONTY

          I was hoping you'd say that. I really
          was.

                     JAKOB

          After that speech, Jesus Christ, how
          could I refuse?
Slattery returns with a glass of whiskey. He sits next to his
friends and sighs.

                    SLATTERY

          There's some talent here tonight.



Monty raps Slattery's knee.

                    MONTY

          What do you think, Jake's girl's looking
          pretty good, huh?

The lights go off. The room is completely dark.



When the lights come on again, a few seconds later, Monty is
crouching in front of the sofa, his .40 caliber automatic in
his hand .



Kostya stands just inside the doorway of the room, hands on
the light switch.




                     KOSTYA

Kostya ambles over to the sofa, wagging his finger.

                   SLATTERY

         Have I ever broken a promise to you? Have
         I ever once in my life broken a promise
         to you? Have I ever said I would be
         somewhere and not shown up?

                    MONTY

        No .

     Monty finally turns and looks at Slattery.

                            MONTY

                But you won't be there tomorrow.

               Anything.

                          MONTY

               Not here . Stick around, okay? We'll go
               uptown in a couple hours.
     Monty points to the dancers below. We can see Mar y dancing
     wildly on a platform.

                         MONTY (CONT'D)

               Our friend Jake has picked himself a
               winner.

    INT. VELVET VIP ROOM -- LATER




    The room is beginning to crowd with Monty's friends and
    acquaintances. Jakob sits alone on the sofa, sipping
    champagne. He clearly recognizes no one .
    The men speak loudly, holding their- champagne flutes in
    ringed fists. Lean women stand in clusters, heads bowed
    together. We hear snippets of banter in four different
    languages.



    Jakob dips his head against the sofa's velvet armrest. He's
    clearly exhausted. He begins slipping into sleep.



    Mary walks into the room. The men standing nearby turn to
    look at her, then whisper to each other and laugh. Mary sees
    Jakob curled up on the sofa and dances over to him.



    She pulls off his Yankees cap and puts it on her own head,
    where it sits, crookedly. She climbs on top of him, her knees
    straddling his chest, and bends close to whisper in his ear.




                        MARY

              Jakey... Jakey...

      CONTINUED,:










O     She runs her fingernail down his side. Jakob, half-sleeping,
      smiles and caresses her hand. Then his eyes pop open. He
      jerks upright and Mary slides off him.

                          JAKOB

                Whoa, what are you doing? What are you
                doing?
      Mary, now standing and slightly swaying, laughs.

                          MARY

                Don't panic. Nobody here gives a shit.

                          JAKOB

                I give a shit. Do you know what happens
                if somebody sees me -- us -- like that?
      Mary sits on the far side of the sofa, knees primly clasped
      together, exaggerating the role of good girl.

                           MARY

                Beg your pardon, Mr. Elinsky.

                          JAKOB

                Are you drunk?
                          MARY                                          ''mm
                Uh huh. And I had some E before.

                          JAKOB

                Jesus.
    : He tries to rub the sleep out of his eyes.

                         JAKOB (CONT'D)

               We call it X in this country.

                         MARY

               Naturelle's cool as shit. She knows
               everyone who works here. I love that
               name, right? Naturelle? One hundred
               percent Naturelle! All Naturelle flavors!
     Jakob cannot help stealing a peek at Mary's chest. Tweety
     Bird stares back, alarmed.

                         MARY (CONT'D)

               So what's up with her boyfriend? Monty?
               It's like he owns this place.

                     JAKOB

           Listen, Mary, do you think it would be
           possible to avoid talking about this at
           school? This whole night?




                     MARY

           You think it would be possible to give me
           an A for the term?
Jakob's mouth falls open.




                     JAKOB

           Tell me you're joking.

                     MARY

          I'm joking. That's what I love about you,
          Elinsky.



Jakob says nothing for a moment, but he can't resist.

                     JAKOB

          What?

                    MARY

          Huh?



Mary is watching three women dancing in the middle of the
room, their purses flung down on the floor between them.

                    JAKOB

          What's what you love about me ?
Mary turns to look at him again, but it's clear she's not
really following the conversation.

                    JAKOB (CONT'D)

          Never mind.

                   MARY

         Hello? Elinsky? Do you think I'm weird?




                   JAKOB

         No. I don't think you're weird.




                   MARY

         You're coming to see Hamlet next week,
         right?

                   JAKOB

         Of course. You're Ophelia?

         Fuck Ophelia. Laertes.

                    MARY

          You want to see my death scene?



She springs up from the sofa and takes three steps back, then
begins staggering toward Jakob, hands folded over her gut,
covering her invisible sword wound.




                     MARY (CONT'D)

          Exchange forgiveness with me , noble
          Hamlet: Min e and my father's death come
          not upon thee , nor thine on me !
She collapses onto the red sofa and lies there, quivering for
a moment before going still.



A group of men smoking cigars in the corner claps loudly.
Jakob stares down at the prone Mary. He cannot hel p noticing
the stretch of pale skin between the dark denim of her
waistband and the white cotton of her tank top.



Mary sits up and brushes some stray hairs under the Yankees
cap.              '

         You think they'd hire a stuntwoman who
         was afraid of heights?

                      JAKOB

            I need to go to sleep.



 Mary lies back on the sofa and kicks her feet in the air. She
 begins a bicycling motion, her hands behind her head.

                     MARY

           Can't sleep yet. He's turning it on .



Jakob looks at her slender pale ankles. He covers his eyes .
Mary rolls off the sofa.

                     MARY (CONT'D)

           Is there a bathroom in here?
Jakob points .

                      JAKOB

           Over there, I think.
Mary winks at him and makes her way across the room. En route
she grabs a champagne flute off Daphne's platter and chugs
it. She replaces the glass and slips into the bathroom.
Jakob watches her go. He watches the bathroom door close
behind her. He stands, a bit unsteadily. He's been drinking
all night . He weaves his way to the bathroom door .
He waits . Eventually Mary opens the door. She looks up at
Jakob, he r "eyes as wide as Tweety Bird's .

                    MARY

          You need to pee?

He presses forward, backing her up , and closes the door
behind him.

 He is watching two high school girls on the swings. One
 blonde -- LINDSAY JAMISON -- and one brunette -- a younger
 Naturelle .
 Both girls wear the uniform of their private school: white
 blouses embroidered with the school's initials and green
 plaid skirts over black tights.
 Both girls are smoking. But while Lindsay keeps the cigarette
 clenched in one hand as she swings higher, Naturelle
 continues taking reckless drags., the crook of her elbow
 holding the chain lightly as she soars skyward.
 Monty stands and approaches the swings. The girls pretend not
 to notice him.

                      MONTY

           Hey!
The girls keep swinging.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

           Could I bum a smoke?

                      NATURELLE

          A smoke.

                    NATURELLE

          This is my last one .
Lindsay brakes with her feet and stares at Monty .

                     LINDSAY

          I've met you before, haven't I?
Monty nods slowly. It's obvious he doesn't recognize her , but
he doesn't want to be rude.

                    MONTY

          Yeah, you look familiar.
Naturelle has stopped swinging now. Lindsay jumps off he r
swing.

                      LINDSAY

          I know wh o you are . Come on , Nat , we've
          got practice.

 Lindsay picks up her bookbag and strides quickly away,
 looking back once or twice to see if Naturelle is following.
 Naturelle is not following.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

           So you're Natalie?

                        NATURELLE

           Naturelle.

                     MONTY

           Really? Naturelle. I like that.
           Naturelle. So what's your friend's
           problem?

                     NATURELLE

           You're the one that got thrown out of
           Campbell-Sawyer, right?

                     MONTY

           Yeah, well, lots of people got thrown out
           of Campbell-Sawyer. How come you didn't
           follow Blondie to practice?

                     NATURELLE

           I want to finish my cigarette.
He smiles and sits on the swing next to her. He tries
swinging a little.

                     MONTY

           I never really got the hang of these
           things.

             - -- " " NATURELLE  -          --       --

           It's all in the legs.
She starts swinging again and he watches her, her long black
hair falling beneath her, her legs straight and then bent,
straight and then bent.

                                                        CUT TO:





INT. WHITE ROOM

Monty's eyes are still closed. Now he opens them. His hands
are in Marguerite's hair, but now they drop by his side.
Finally he taps Marguerite on the shoulders. She backs away
from him, looking up at his face for a moment before blinking
and licking her lips.

 He hands her the bottle again and she takes a long sip.




                      MARGUERITE

                (Colombian accent)
           You are very handsome. Are you an actor ?



 Monty zips his fly.

                     MONTY

           Yeah. I'm a star.




 INT. CLUB ROOM -- LATER

The club room is decorated to look like the library of an
English country manor : dark wood paneling, bookshelves
stacked with leather-bound books, flickering sconce lights.
Slattery sits on a stool at the bar, rolling a glass of
whiskey between his palms. His eyes are red, from crying or
exhaustion or both.



Naturelle walks into the room and spots Slattery. She goes
over to him and squeezes the back of his neck before sitting
on the neighboring stool. He sits up straight and smiles.

                    NATURELLE

          Why are you all alone?

                     SLATTERY

          I couldn't sit in that goddamn red room
          anymore. I don't know anyone in there .
          These are Monty's friends?--

                     NATURELLE

          I guess so . They're around a lot, anywayv
Slattery drains his whiskey. He signals for another and the
bartender pours it . He's clearly getting drunk, though
Slattery is a man who can handle his liquor. He checks his
watch.

                    SLATTERY

         I'm supposed to be at work in a couple

            He's probably saying goodbye to everyone.

                      NATURELLE

            Can you do me a favor?

                      SLATTERY

            What's that?
 Slattery catches himself looking at Naturelle's cleavage and
 looks away.

                     NATURELLE

           Keep an eye on Monty tonight, would you?
           Try to stick with him.

                     SLATTERY

           What's wrong?

                     NATURELLE

           He's just acting really strange. You
           don't think he's acting strange?

                     SLATTERY

           He's going to prison in a few hours, Nat.
           How do you want him to act?

                     NATURELLE

           I want him to act like he's scared.

                     SLATTERY

           He is scared.

                    NATURELLE

          I don't want him to hurt himself. Will
          you watch him for me?   ..-TO.,,,,,..--.
Slattery nods. For a while they are quiet.

                    NATURELLE (CONT'D)

          I don't think he wants me here.

                    SLATTERY

          That's not true. He's just --

                    NATURELLE

          You see the way he looks at me these
          days. It's like he doesn't trust me .

                    SLATTERY

          Why wouldn't he trust you?
Naturelle is quiet for a moment.

 She stands and smooths out the wrinkles in her silver dress .
 Again, Slattery has to turn away from the sight of her .

                      SLATTERY

           This is all so stupid. It's so stupid.
           He's got so much going on, he's so smart,
           and what does he do? He throws it al l
           away. An d here I am, his friend -- I mean ,

           He loves you, Frank. You know that.

                       SLATTERY

           His oldest friend, and what do I do to
           stop it? Nothing, never a word. When he
           started selling pot to kids in Campbell -
           Sawyer, did I say anything? When
          everyone's talking about buying from
          Monty, the whole school, and I knew they
          were going to nail him, knew it, did I
          say a word? The last ten years I watc h
          him get deeper and deeper, and these
          friends of his, these fucks you wouldn't
          want petting your dog, did I say,
          "Careful now, Monty, better get out of
          this. " No . Nothing, not a word. His bes t
          friend. Goddamn, Naturelle, I'm his bes t
          friend and I just sat there and watched
          him ruin his life. And you did, too . Both
          of-us.,., all -of us , we just sat there and

Naturelle runs a fingernail down her forearm an d inspects the
faint white trail .

          Keep an eye on him, okay?



Slattery watches her walk away. A moment later Jakob hurries
in, sweating and frantic.

                    JAKOB

         I've been looking all over for you. Can
         we get out of here?




                   SLATTERY

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY -- LATER

Monty and Kostya walk slowly down the corridor that leads to
the manager's office.

          So? You like her?

       door. MUSTAFAYEV, a balding man smoking a cigarette, opens
       the door and closes it behind him. He nods.
       Monty and Kostya pull out their guns and hand them to him.
       Checking the safeties, he shoves the guns under his belt and,
       cigarette clenched between his teeth, carefully pats both men
       down.
       When Mustafayev finishes searching them he raps on the door
       and it opens again. He gestures, and Monty and Kostya enter.

       INT. VELVET MANAGER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

       Mustafayev follows them inside, hands their guns to one of
       the ZAKHAROV twins, and goes back outside, closing the door.
       The twins are Russian redheads who speak very little English.
       Their faces are blunted and pitiless.
      Uncle Blue sits behind Volandes' desk, reading the paper.
      Valghobek sits on a corner of the desk.
      The twin with the guns places them carefully in front of
"     Uncle Blue, then returns to stand by his brother, both of
      them standing behind Monty and Kostya.
      DJ Dusk's music can barely be heard down here, the thump of
      bass and drum sounding like distant bombshells.
      Uncle Blue folds his paper neatly and sets it aside.

                It's all right. Thanks for setting it up.

                The first time I went to prison I was
                fourteen years old, a skinny little boy.
                Very afraid. By the time I came out I had
                my beard. I was a grown man. I went back
                to my hometown, I found my mother, I
                kissed her. And she screamed.
                     (smiling)
                She did not recognize me . I have been in
                three different prisons, Montgomery, in
                three different countries. You know what
                I learned?
     Monty shakes his head and waits.

              Seven years is a long time. Some men

              Yes .

              At least he has a short commute. He can
              practically walk to work. Where does he
              live, 17th Avenue? And what was the cross-
              street? 81st? 8002 17th Avenue. Is that
              right? The first floor. That must be
              noisy, living on the first floor. But he
              doesn't walk to work, does he? He drives.
            -A 1987 Honda. Should-I tell you how many
              miles he has on the car?
    Monty stares at the floor.

                        UNCLE BLUE

             Your father, I like your father. A hard-
             working man. He has had bad luck, some
             very bad luck. Everyone in the
             neighborhood loved your mother. You

     Uncle Blue turns Monty's gun in his hands. He checks the
     slide's action. He ejects the magazine, peers at the top
     cartridge, slaps the magazine back into the pistol's butt,

     Monty shakes his head. He turns around for a moment. The
     Zakharov twins are staring at him. Monty turns back. Uncle
     Blue smiles.

out. Monty, getting desperate, turns back to Uncle Blue.

          I never said a word to anyone. They came

Uncle Blue makes a gesture and the Zakharovs, frighteningly
fast, spring forward, slamming Kostya to the floor and
holding their pistols to his skull.

                     UNCLE BLUE

          I believe you, Montgomery. When you get
          there, figure out who is who. Find a man
          nobody is protecting, a man without
          people. And beat him until his eyes
          bleed.

dripping from his nose.

over to Monty and offers it to him.

his face, until Monty grabs it from him.

           Right here. Boom!
The Zakharovs back away and Monty crouches down beside his
former friend. Kostya struggles to turn his head, to make eye
contact with Monty.                                                     !

        CONTINUED: (5)







        Monty flicks off the safety and presses the muzzle against
        Kostya's skull.
        Everyone in the room is quiet, watching.
        The only sound is DJ Dusk's mix, an accelerating industrial
        heartbeat.

                             VALGHOBEK

                  Do it.
        Kostya weeps, softly, his big body shuddering.
        Uncle Blue, face impassive behind his heavy beard, watches
        carefully.

                            ZAKHAROV

                  He is cockroach. Kill him.
        Monty's face is very close to Kostya's.

                             MONTY

                       (quietly)
                  You were my friend.

       Monty closes his eyes.
       When he opens his eyes, he flicks the safety back on. He
       stands.
       He tosses the gun to Uncle Blue, who catches it and frowns.

                       _   MONTY,

                 It doesn't matter to me . Not a goddamn
                 thing matters to me , except this: if you
                 hurt my father, I'll kill you both.
       The Zakharov twins grab Monty and hold him. Monty doesn't
       struggle; he and Uncle Blue stare at each other.
       Uncle Blue drums the desktop with his fingers. Everyone
       waits. A glass of water on the table trembles from the
       distant bass.
       Finally Uncle Blue nods at Valghobek, who opens the office
       door. The twins release Monty. Everyone (except for Kostya,
       who is face down on the floor) watches him.



                                                                            o

 EXT. 14TH STREET -- LATER

 Monty trudges down the sidewalk, followed by Slattery and
 Jakob. The snow continues to fall, and lies thickly drifted
 on the crookedly-parked cars, on the parking meters, on the
 spears of the church gate they pass.
 They reach the Union Square subway station and walk down the
 stairs, disappearing from our view.

 CLOSE ON FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW

 We slowly follow their path backward. In the yellow shine of
 the streetlights the footprints fill with snow, until finally
 (the camera still moving backward) they disappear.

 INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION

 Monty, Frank, and Jakob sit with their backs against the
""'corrugated shutters of a closed newspaper stand.
 An OLD MAN,    wearing   a garbage bag with a hole cut out for his
 head, leans    against   a blue I-beam that helps support the
 ceiling. He    holds a   small radio to his ear; we can hear
 fragments of    Puerto   Rican Jibaro music.
Jakob chews on his fingernails. He cranes his neck to look
down the subway tunnel -- still no train in sight. He looks at
Monty.

                     JAKOB

           What time is it?
But Monty is jnot present, he is elsewhere, lost in whatever
feveFie occuples""his mind. Slattery's eyes are clo~sed;-he-
seems to be sleeping.

                          JAKOB {CONT'D)

          Monty?
Monty looks up, dazed.

                          MONTY

          What?

                    JAKOB

          Do you know what time it is?
Another long pause.

                    MONTY

          It's getting late.

 The lights of the train come around the bend in the tunnel.

 INT. 4 TRAIN -- LATER

 The three men sit side by side as the train shudders through
 the darkness. Slattery seems to be sleeping again. Jakob
 stares at his reflected face in the far window.
 Monty pulls out his wallet and finds the photograph that his
 father gave him earlier in the night.

 INSERT PHOTO

 Monty in his fireman's helmet, standing before his parents.

 EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING -- NIGHT

 Monty, Slattery and Jakob wade through the snow to the stoop
 steps.

 INT. MONTY'S BUILDING

They climb the narrow staircase, their footfalls echoing off
the tiled walls.

INT. MONTY'S APARTMENT                                                ,-~^

They enter the apartment. Doyle is excited to see them; he             -
pants and spins in little circles, sniffing at their boots.
Jakob and Slattery fall onto the sofa and lie there like
corpses.
Monty opens the bedroom door, steps inside, and closes it
behind him.

INT- MONTY'S BEDROOM

Naturelle sleeps on her side, facing the window. Monty kneels
beside her and takes her hand. Her eyes open. She smiles for
a second and then quickly sits up.

                    NATURELLE

          What time is it?
Both of them turn to look at the digital clock on the
nightstand.

                    MONTY

          I've got an hour left. Listen --
Naturelle waits as Monty stares down at the bed.                      ^J

                I was wrong. About you, about --
   She runs her hand through his hair.

                         NATURELLE

               It doesn't matter right now.

                           MONTY

               It matters to me.
                    (beat)
               I don't want you to hate me.

                         NATURELLE

               How could I ever hate you?

                         MONTY

               Jesus, Nat, I blew it. I really blew it.
  He stands.

                          NATURELLE

               Stay with me, baby. We have another hour.

                         MONTY

               There's one last thing I gotta do.
  Naturelle doesn't like the sound of this remark. She leans
  forward and takes his wrist.

                       NATURELLE

             Hey. Don't go anywhere. Stay here with
             me.

             Just one last thing.
 He kisses her again, a last fierce kiss, and heads for the
 door.

 INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM

 Monty grabs the leash off the back of the apartment door and
 clips it to Doyle's collar.

                       MONTY

             Let me take one more walk with Doyle.
 Slattery and Jakob nod. Both are exhausted.

EXT. EAST END AVENUE ~ LATER

The snow has finally stopped falling.




                                                         (CONTINUED)

 CONTINUED:







 The parked cars lining the avenue look like scoops of vanilla
 ice cream, glistening below the streetlights. The awnings of
 the buildings, fringed with icicles, creak beneath the weight
 of the snow.
 Doyle, off his leash, charges down the middle of the avenue,
 carving a trail through the foot-deep powder, a drop of ink
 rolling down a blank page.
Monty follows behind, twirling circles with the leash.
Slattery and Jakob bring up the rear, slogging through the
snow like weary soldiers.
The only vehicle on the road is a snow plow half a mile
south, its yellow lights flashing.

EXT. CARL SCHURZ PARK

They cross into the park, past the fenced-in gingko trees,
climbing the stairs that lead to the esplanade.
Doyle spies a squirrel and chases after it, but the squirrel
is quicker, makes it to a red maple and scrambles up the
trunk to safety.
Doyle squats at the foot of the tree, staring sadly up                 ^\
through the branches.                                                11W7

EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE

Across the river is Queens, and Queens before sunrise is
beautiful: red antennae lights winking to warn pilots; the
Pepsi sign glowing in neon script over the bottling plant;
white clouds rising from the smokestacks like genies.
Behind Queens the sky is beginning to brighten.       -   --
Jakob brushes snow off the iron balustrade, leans against it
and stares into the river. A string of yellow lights quivers
beneath the waters, reflections from the Queensboro Bridge.
A red tugboat chugs south.

                    MONTY

          It would be good to work a tugboat. Be
          out on the river all day.
He turns to face Jakob.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          So what do you think? You ready for Mr.
          Doyle?

     CONTINUED:







     Jakob looks at Doyle, who is rolling on his back in the snow,
     kicking his feet in the air like a puppy.

                         JAKOB

               He likes the snow.
     Monty whistles for Doyle and the dog jumps to his feet and
     runs over, wagging the stump of his tail, his muzzle dusted
     with snow.

                         MONTY

               I need a favor, Frank.

                           SLATTERY

               Anything.
    Monty refastens the leash onto the dog's collar and ties the
    cord around a baluster, knotting it twice, checking to make
    sure it's secure.

                          MONTY

               I'm not going in there like this. The
               minute they get a look at me, I'm gone.
    Monty straightens up and looks directly into Slattery's eyes.

-


                        MONTY (CONT'D)

              Make me ugly.
    Slattery looks dumbfounded. He turns to glance at Jakob, who
    is equally confused.
    Monty clears the snow off the nearest bench, unbuttons his
    camel's hair coat, and lays it down.

                        MONTY (CONT'D)

              You just said you'd do anything. So this
              is what I need.

                         SLATTERY

              I can't do that. What are you thinking, I
              give you a black eye and people won't
              fuck with you? It won't change anything.
    Monty steps closer.

                        MONTY

              You think I deserve it, don't you?
    Slattery holds his hands up and backs away.

                        SLATTERY

              I can't hit you.

                    I think you can. I think you want to, a
                    little bit. I think you've wanted to for
                    years.

                               SLATTERY

                    I'm not doing it.
         Monty steps closer again.

                              MONTY

                    You want to. Come on, Frank, you're
                    afraid?

                   What are you afraid of, Frank? That I'll
                   hit back? You're afraid I'll hit back?
                   That would be embarrassing, huh, big
                   tough guy like you getting his ass
                   kicked?

        Monty points at Jakob.

                             MONTY

                   Who the fuck is talking to you?

                             SLATTERY

                   Forget it. Come on, forget all this.
                   Let's get some breakfast.

                            MONTY

                  This works out pretty well for you,
                  doesn't it? You're gonna take good care
                  of Naturelle while I'm gone?

                                SLATTERY

                  What?

                             MONTY

                  You think I don't see you staring at her
                  all the time? You've wanted to fuck her
                  for years.
        He shoves Slattery hard. Slattery's eyes narrow for a moment,
        but he shakes his head.

           All right. Al l right.



 He turns stiffly and walks away.




 '                    JAKOB

           Come on. Come on , Monty, what are you
           doing? Tell him you're kidding.
 Monty pivots and punches Jakob hard on the cheek, the crack
 of gloved knuckle on bone echoing on the empty esplanade.
 Jakob falls back against the balustrade, clutching his face.

                     JAKOB (CONT'D)

           Monty I



Monty steps closer and punches Jakob again, this time in the
gut, and Jakob sinks to his knees, gasping. He covers his
face with his hands, to protect himself.
Slattery tackles Monty, pinning him to the ground.
For a moment everything is still. Doyle, leashed to the
baluster, whines, unsure if his master is playing or
fighting.
Jakob, stunned by the violence, watches. Slattery stares at
Monty and Monty stares back . All :of them in the snow, their
breath coiling and rising into the sky.
Finally Slattery looks away, looks past the East River , past
Queens. He clenches his eyes shut. When he opens them, we see
the first tears forming.
Slattery grabs Monty's throat with his left hand and punches
him in the face with his right, again and again and again.
Doyle howls. He tries to jump on Slattery bu t the leash keeps
yanking him back. He strains forward, fangs bared , bu t his
master is three feet too far.



Jakob touches his cheek and examines his fingers: no blood.



Doyle, barking madly, keeps jumping for Slattery, keeps being
yanked back by the leash.



Jakob grabs hold of the balustrade and pulls himsel f to his
feet.

                    JAKOB (CONT'D)

 The bloo d puddles by Monty's head, melting through the snow
 and steaming in the air. Slattery, lost in hi s anger , his
 frustration, continues swinging.



 Jakob stumbles over to Slattery and pushes him.




                        JAKOB (CONT'D)

            Stop!



 Slattery looks up , his face wet with tears , a webbin g of
 saliva between his lips .

                      JAKOB (CONT'D)

            Okay. Enough.



 Jakob grabs the bi g man under the armpits and help s hi m rise .
 Slattery looks down at Monty, who is not moving .

                        SLATTERY

           Oh Jesus .
Jakob crouches and turns Monty onto his stomach . Monty
coughs, a thick ribbon of blood falling from hi s mouth .
Jakob scoops up a handful of snow and begins gentl y pressing
it to Monty's brutalized face.
Doyle continues to bark, the collar digging into his throat
as he struggles to reach his master.
Slattery watches , speechless, his bloodied hand s by his side.
Finally Monty shakes his head clear of the snow and begins
crawling forward.






           Hold still for a minute. Hold still .
When Monty tries to stand his legs collapse beneat h him.
Jakob wraps his arms around him before he falls an d lowers
him to the snow.




                    JAKOB (CONT'D)

          Don't try to move yet.



Monty pushes himsel f off the ground again and thi s time
manages to keep hi s balance, though he sways lik e a drunk.




                      MONTY

               (slurring)
          It's okay .

 Blood leaks from his nose, from his mouth, from a deep gash
 bisecting one eyebrow. The entire left side of his face is
 bright red, already swelling.



 Slattery looks at him and moans , sits down heavily in the
 snow, his chin tucked against his chest, his right hand,
 slick with blood, covering his face.




                        SLATTERY

           Oh Jesus.




                      JAKOB

           Hospital.. We need to take you to the
           hospital.

                       MONTY

           No .
He staggers toward them. Doyle is mewling now, stomping his
paws, confused. Monty bends down unsteadily and scratches
behind the dog's ear.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

               (to Doyle)
           Be a good boy.
He walks over to Slattery, wh o sits in the snow, sobbing.
Monty leans over and kisses his forehead.




                       MONTY (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry.
Slattery rocks back and forth, hands over his face, his
forehead marked with blood.
Monty turns to Jakob and touches his shoulder.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry, Jake.



Jakob is stunned by what's happened in the last few minutes .
He has no idea what to say.




                       JAKOB

          Okay.




                    MONTY

          Take care of my dog.



He grabs his coat from the park bench and walks away from
them.




                                                             107











 EXT. MONTY' S BUILDING -- DAWN                                     (

 Naturelle, in her down parka, sits on the stoop steps. She
 sees him when he's a block away, and we see him from that
 distance, limping through the snow.
 Naturelle stands and breathes in deeply. She starts walking
 toward him but stops after a few steps. She can see his face
 now.
His eyes are so badly swollen that he doesn't notice her
until he's almost upon her. When he does see her he smiles,
and Naturelle has to look away for a moment.
He tries to say something but chokes, leans over, hands on
his knees, and spits up blood.
Naturelle takes him by the hand and leads him up the steps.

INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM

He sits on the sofa while Naturelle dabs at his face with a
wet washcloth. A bowl of soapy water sits beside her on the
coffee table.
When she wrings the washcloth above the bowl, drops of blood       ,"***S

                                                                    /   >

                    MONTY

          I don't want you to visit.
His voice is rough and slurred, his split lip impeding his
diction.
She opens a bottle of rubbing alcohol, wets a cotton ball,
presses the cottpn lightly against the gash in his forehead.       --
He shudders, his fingers gripping the edges of the sofa
cushions.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          I don't want you to see me up there.
Naturelle struggles mightily to keep herself together. She
continues cleaning his wounds.

                     MONTY (CONT'D)

         Why'd you stay with me?
              (beat)
         You should have left a long time ago.

                 (shaking her head)
            You idiot.
 A knock on the door. Naturelle goes to answer it. We hear
 voices that sound very distant. Monty peers through his
 swollen eyelids at the man walking toward him.

                                                          CUT TO:


 MONTY'S POV

 The blurred figure of a man stands before him. The room is
 sunlight and shadows, all edges washed away;
 The man's face is a pale oval that bends and splits when he
 speaks.

                     MR. BROGAN

           Who did this to you?

                                                          CUT TO:

Monty sitting on the sofa, staring up at his father.

                     MR. BROGAN (CONT'D)

           Who did this to you, Monty?

                    MONTY

          What time is it?

                     MR. BROGAN

          I'm bringing you to the hospital. We can
          tell--

                    MONTY

          No. I need to go.
He pushes himself upright. Naturelle comes in from the
kitchen and hands him a glass of water. He takes it and
drinks.

                     NATURELLE

          You have to go to the hospital, baby.

                    MONTY

          No.
Monty goes to his bedroom.




        INT. MONTY'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

\v_y    He pulls an already packed suitcase from beneath the bed. He
  ~"    grabs the string of silver rosary beads from the bedside
        table.
        He stares at the unmade bed for a few seconds before leaving.

        INT. MONTY'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

        He sets his suitcase by the front door.

                            MONTY

                  I'll say goodbye here.
        He approaches his father but Mr. Brogan shakes his head.

                             MR. BROGAN

                  How you planning on getting to the Port
                  Authority?

                            MONTY

                  Subway.

                              MR. BROGAN

                  You won't make it. Trains are barely
                  running right now. I'll drive you to
                  Otisville.
                       (beat)
                  Jesus, look what they did to you.

                            MONTY

                  I'll take a taxi.

                           NATURELLE

                 You won't be able to get one. Let him
                 take you to the hospital.

                           MR. BROGAN

                 You don't trust my driving? I got chains
                 on the tires and everything.

                           MONTY

                 I don't want it like this. Let me walk
                 away, Dad. It's easier that way.

                           MR. BROGAN

                 What's easy about it? Easier? My God, you
                 don't understand, do you? You don't have
                 any idea.
       He touches Monty's shoulder.

            Let me drive you there. I need to see
            where it is anyway, for visits. Okay,
            buddy? Help me out .



Monty blinks and then nods .




                      MONTY

            No hospitals.



Mr . Brogan kisses Naturelle on the cheek and she embraces the
older man . When she lets go he walks to the front door, pick s
up the suitcase, and leaves the apartment.
Monty stands still, looking at Naturelle.

                     NATURELLE

           Wait a second.
She goes to the kitchen and Monty rocks back and forth on his
bootheels. When she returns she holds a plastic ba g filled
with ice cubes.
She makes him hold the bag against the side of his face. They
don't move for a moment, her hand on top of his hand, the ba g
of ice pressed to his jaw.

                     MONTY

           I want you to be happy.



She nods but says nothing, biting her lip, tears beginning to
roll down her face.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          Will you d that for me ?



She nods again.

                      MONTY (CONT'D)

          Okay?



She grabs him and holds him very hard, clutching him, sobbing
into his neck.

                    MONTY (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry for everything.




                     NATURELLE

          No . . .




                     MONTY

          Fo r everything .

    He kisses her again and releases her, walks out the apartment
    door and closes it behind him.

    INT. HALLWAY

    Monty unknots the plastic bag and dumps the ice down the
    stairwell. The cubes glitter and disappear before clattering
    on the linoleum three floors below.

    EXT. MONTY'S BUILDING

    Mr. Brogan's car is double-parked. The roof of the old Honda
    is crowned with snow but the windshield and rear window have
    been swept clean.

    INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA

    Mr. Brogan opens the passenger door and Monty eases carefully
    into the seat, then leans over to unlock the driver's door.
After Mr. Brogan starts the engine, they wait for a moment
for the windows to defrost.

                        MR. BROGAN

              FDR is closed. I figured we'd go up
              First, take the Triborough, catch 87 up
              to Route 17, and then 211 takes us right
              into Otisville. Easy drive, except for
              the snow.
Monty says nothing, and Mr. Brogan studies his savaged face.

                          MR. BROGAN (CONT'D)

              Jesus, look what they did to you. I'll
              tell you what, Monty, you're gonna be
              okay. It looks bad now, I know it, but
              when all the swelling goes down it's
-           - gonna be okayr     ~ ~"    -- -

             They sure gave you a licking, though. How
             many were there?

                       MONTY

             I don't know, Dad. A bunch of them.

                       MR. BROGAN

             Well, give it a month and you'll be
             better looking than ever.
A fire truck rolls slowly past, chains on its massive tires.
Monty and his father sit in silence, letting the engine warm.

                        MONTY

             You were right, Dad. It wasn't Naturelle.
 Mr. Brogan shifts into drive.

                      MR. BROGAN

            Of course it wasn't Naturelle.

 EXT. EAST RIVER ESPLANADE -- DAWN

 Slattery sits on a park bench overlooking the river. It's the
 same bench Monty sat on the day before. Slattery is alone on
 the snow-covered esplanade.
 His knuckles are covered with dried blood. His forehead is
 marked with blood.
 He watches the sun rise over Queens.

 EXT. EAST END AVENUE -- DAWN

 Jakob and Doyle walk south along the western edge of Carl
 Schurz Park. A SKIER, an attractive young woman in her mid-
 twenties, schusses toward them on cross-country skis.
 She smiles at Jakob as she passes.

                       SKIER

           Cool dog.

                       JAKOB

           Thanks.
He turns and watches her glide down the hill toward 86th
Street. He looks down: at Doyle. Doyle looks-iap- at ~hifff. TM   -

                       JAKOB (CONT'D)

           Cool dog.
Jakob shakes his head and smiles, and they continue walking
south.

INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING

They drive up First Avenue. Monty looks out the window and
watches the city roll by. It's his last look for a long time,
and he wants to remember everything.
A WOMAN wearing a man's overcoat sprinkles salt in front of a
shuttered butcher shop. Two YOUNG BOYS drag their sleds
behind them, huffing and puffing with exaggerated fatigue.

 A NEWSPAPER VENDOR sits on a blue milk crate, sipping coffee
 from a paper cup, while his CURLY-HAIRED SON snaps icicles
 from the kiosk's eaves.
 A POLICE OFFICER, hands on his hips, stares under the opened
 hood of his cruiser, while his PARTNER leans against the
 driver's-side door and laughs into his walkie-talkie.
At a red light, Monty looks up at the city bus idling noisily
alongside them. A LITTLE BOY in the backseat waves. Monty
waves back.
The boy points at his window: letters have been finger-drawn
on the frosted glass. T-O-M.
Monty smiles as well as he can and draws his own name on his
own frosted window: M-O-N-
Before he can cross the T the bus pulls away.
They drive north.

          I always thought I'd make you proud of
          me .
M r . Brogan turns to look at Monty and then turns back to the
road.

                      MONTY (CONT'D)

           I pictured it, you know? I pictured you
           sitting at the bar with all your friends,
           poker night, and you'd say, "Did I tell
           you what my boy's been up to?" And your
           friends would be like, "Goddamnit,

           you want, I'll do it.
Monty closes his eyes. We hear the tire chains rattling on
the snow. We hear the old engine wheezing.
CLOSE on Monty's ravaged face, on his eyelids.
Mr. Brogan keeps talking and New York City melts away.

 Mr. Brogan parks in front of a small bar with an old-

 INT. TOWN BAR -- DAY

 Mr. Brogan and Monty are sitting at a corner table. Mr .
 Brogan raises his glass of whiskey to Monty and both men
 drink.

                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)

           Find a bar, and I'll buy us drinks. I
           haven't had a drink in nineteen years,
           but I'll have one with you. And then I'll
           leave.

Monty stands at the window of the bar, watching Mr. Brogan
drive away.

                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          I'll tell you don't ever write me, don't
          ever come visit. I'll tell you I believe
          in God's Kingdom and I believe I'll be
          with you again, and your mother. But not
          in this lifetime.
Monty approaches the BARTENDER, a powerfully-built older man
(60). Monty speaks and the bartender listens carefully, but
we don't hear the dialogue.

                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          You get a job somewhere, a job that pays
          cash, a boss who doesn't ask questions,
          and you make a new life, and you never
          come back.

                                                       CUT TO:


INT. TOWN BAR -- NIGHT

Monty works behind the bar on a crowded night. The bar
PATRONS, a blue-collar rural crowd, are rowdy drinkers, but
Monty works efficiently, quickly filling their orders.

                                                       CUT TO:

  INT. HEAD SHOP -- NIGHT

 Monty, in the backroom of a seedy head shop, sits for a
 photograph in front of a black drop.

                      MR. BROGAN (V.O.)

            You find the right people and you get
            yourself papers, a driver's license.

 EXT. TOWN BAR -- DAY

 Monty sits on the steps in back of the bar, looking out past
 the gravel lot toward the distant mountains.

                      MR. BROGAN (V.O.)

           And then you wait. People get caught when
           they come home. But you're never coming
           home.

 EXT. BUS STATION -- DAY

 Monty, a few years older, waits as a Greyhound bus pulls into
 the station.

                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)

           And maybe -- and this is dangerous-- but
           maybe after a couple years you send word
           to Naturelle.
Naturelle steps off the Greyhound bus. She sees Monty. They
stare at each other, twenty feet apart.
Finally he goes to her, threading through the other
travellers, the other waiting families. He takes her in his
arms.

INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

In the cramped apartment above the bar where Monty works,
Monty and Naturelle sit together, on a sofa, watching a small
television. Naturelle is pregnant.
The ball is about to drop in Times Square.

                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.)

          You forget about New York. You can't come
          back. You can't call, you can't write.

INT. SMALL HOUSE -- NIGHT

Monty, much older now, stands in front of his family, his
grown CHILDREN and the little GRANDCHILDREN. Naturelle,
equally aged, sits with one of the little girls on her lap.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)

          And maybe one day, years from now, long
          after I'm dead and gone, you gather your
          whole family together and you tell them
          the truth. Who you are and where you came
          from.
As Monty speaks his children exchange glances. They can't
really believe what they're hearing, but they know their
father is telling the truth.

                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          You tell them the whole thing. And then
          you ask them if they know how lucky they
          are to be there.
Monty looks at his family. He is awed by their existence, by
the life he has created. He looks at Naturelle, still
beautiful in old age, and she smiles back at him.

                    OLD MONTY

          It all came so close to never happening.

INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING

The sun shines through the windshield. Monty sleeps, his
battered head resting against the window below his frost-
spelt name: M-O-N-T-Y.

                     OLD MONTY (V.O.)

          This life came so close to never
          happening.
