365 ASH             365	 buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his head;	ASH	 (muttering under his breath) Rest in pieces.	366 ASH             366	 backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the grave. A flash of lightning reveals...	367 THE GRAVEYARD           367	 in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel GROANS in the gale.	Army of Darkness 
418 THE ARMS            418	 reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.	ASH	 (in a snarl) Keep you damn filthy bones outta my mouth. SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!	419 ASH CLIMBS              419				Army of Darkness
