ARTHUR	 Evening, Constable!	OLDER COP 1	 (seen it all before) Hi, Arthur.	ARTHUR	 Are you familiar with the expression `I can explain everything'?	OLDER COP 1	 Out of the car, please.	Arthur 
GARY	 I burnt my sister's hair.	JAY	 (high fiving him) Cool...	GARY	 Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause I don't fit her definition of hygiene. Plenty of places to take a shit, toilet's just one of them. Just ask the a-rabs.	ARTHUR	 It's like a chat show, this. (looking into an imaginary	Arthur 
GARY	 Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause I don't fit her definition of hygiene. Plenty of places to take a shit, toilet's just one of them. Just ask the a-rabs.	ARTHUR	 It's like a chat show, this. (looking into an imaginary	CAMERA)	 It's been said of my next guest, by Jay the bandaged lunatic, that she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out, whacked-up asswipe'. (to a PROSTITUTE) Carmella, when did you first dream of becoming a crack whore?	PROSTITUTE	 Mother died when I was six.	Arthur 
ARTHUR	 It's like a chat show, this. (looking into an imaginary	CAMERA)	 It's been said of my next guest, by Jay the bandaged lunatic, that she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out, whacked-up asswipe'. (to a PROSTITUTE) Carmella, when did you first dream of becoming a crack whore?	PROSTITUTE	 Mother died when I was six.	ARTHUR	 Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.	Arthur 
ARTHUR	 I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep easy tonight.	JAY	 (points at A CAMERAMAN) Don't point that shit at me, bitch! I will FUCK YOU UP! Jay attacks the cameraman violently. Gary piles in.	HOMELESS ROBIN	 Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards! Arthur pushes past the press.	PRESS	 Arthur! What will your mother say? Didn't she send you here to get you out of the British papers? Arthur!	Arthur 
FIRST MAN	 Um. $800 please.	ARTHUR	 Coming right up. (keys it in) Fries with that? The man laughs, along with others in the line, including Sofia who catches his eye.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 Congratulations everyone! THE	RECESSION'S OVER!	 Arthur dials a number on his gold iPhone.	Arthur 
ARTHUR		(TAKEN ABACK)	 Erica? Fancy meeting you here! Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the very best friend forever of my girlfriend Susan. And Erica's parents Ernest and Margaret. (to Erica and her parents) Are you familiar with the expression `I can't explain anything'?	ERICA	 Who are the women with you, Arthur?	ARTHUR	 Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe she works for Avis. Checks the cars for dings, dead people in the trunk, that sort of thing. And this is Carmella. Anyway...	Arthur 
ARTHUR	 (noticing Sofia's stopped having sex with him) Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry. How impolite of me. Sofia, this is Hobson, my nanny.	SOFIA	 Nanny?	HOBSON	 He's merely shaped like an adult.			Arthur 
ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 Not the death metal, please!	HOBSON	 (shouting over the music) Aren't you a fan of Carcass? Hobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen.	HOBSON (CONT'D)	 `Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a classic of its genre.	ARTHUR		Arthur 
HOBSON	 With the emphasis on the `pissed'. Really, what is it about unearned wealth that brings out such idiocy in those who have it and those who want it? The way you're going, you'll have spent your inheritance before you've inherited it.	ARTHUR	 (shifts to new pose) `Eagle pointing at lesbian.'	HOBSON	 Why did you fire Jessica?	ARTHUR	 What kind of yoga teacher won't let a pupil invent positions? She was a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D.	Arthur 
ARTHUR	 Wow. What did you say?	NAOMI	 Just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals. (to the tourists) Everyone make it over alive? Excellent. Next we enter Times Square, world famous for New Year's Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball descends at eye-poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools. Many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise.	(TO ARTHUR)	 Sir? What shape is Times Square?	ARTHUR	 A circle?	Arthur 
NAOMI		(TO ARTHUR)	 Sorry, this pretzel stand is a watering hole for the crazies. (raises her voice to	HOBSON)	 The soup kitchen's just up and to the left, honey.	ARTHUR	 Hobson, this is... (reads her badge) Naomi.	Arthur 
HOBSON)	 The soup kitchen's just up and to the left, honey.	ARTHUR	 Hobson, this is... (reads her badge) Naomi.	NAOMI	 She's with you?			Arthur 
ARTHUR	 Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your parents are you most like? Abercrombie or Fitch?	GRANT	 (doesn't get the joke) I have no connection with that store. My family name is Von Krausehoff. Take a seat please. Arthur and Hobson sit down. Grant picks up a phone.	GRANT (CONT'D)	 Vivienne? (conspiratorial, flirty) White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.			Arthur 
VIVIENNE	 Susan is 33 this year. Her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her. You risk having no sons, or worse, some pea-brained hunchback who hugs everyone!	ARTHUR	 Great! I like hugs! And some of them are really good at math. (heading to the door) You know the `Frog and Toad' books?	VIVIENNE	 No.	ARTHUR	 Of course you don't. Hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles. They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles I can squirt up a rich girl.	Arthur 
HOBSON	 Ah. The ring your father gave your mother, I recall.	ARTHUR	 (feeling its huge weight) Did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his Bentley?	HOBSON	 No. Your father was a gentleman.	ARTHUR	 What's gentlemanly about dying before I knew him? That's just rude. Did he ever love my mother?	Arthur 
ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 Bollocks.	(TO JESUS)	 Sorry. Actually, you couldn't, um....you know... (points to the water) ...turn this into a nice 1990 Romanee Conti, could you? He sips the water as if it's wine. Lifts it to Jesus.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 Cheers ears. He checks out a huge, very old, rusty sword on the wall. Beneath it is a small information plaque.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 `Genuine Sword of the First Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'. He looks around, then reaches up and takes it off. It's VERY heavy and clanks to the ground, slamming his foot.	Arthur 
BURT	 My faith teaches me to hate the sin, not the sinner. But with you, I struggle with that belief. Burt turns away to get a glass of water.	ARTHUR	 You could switch to Judaism. (glances up at the fan) Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I put the fan on? Arthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more water. Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again, until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off. Arthur catches it. Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight temporarily.	BURT	 Anyway, Arthur. However I feel about you, my daughter loves you.	ARTHUR	 Yes, it's a problem, isn't it? Arthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of shot and puts the head back on Jesus's body.	Arthur 
NAOMI	 What are you gonna do? All those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the TV. And then one day, you're the one saying `No, honey, it's bad for you! Go to bed.' Weird, huh?	ARTHUR	 (not relating at all) Yeah. I hate that. (looks at her phone) Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you find that?	NAOMI	 AT&T; store in 1998.	ARTHUR	 It's...You've had it twelve years?	Arthur 
NAOMI	 You're seriously making date small talk while this is going on?	ARTHUR	 Be still. Breathe deep. (strikes a Zen pose) `When you can be calm in the midst of activity, this is the true state of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.	NAOMI	 `Lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': Naomi Snart.			Arthur 
NAOMI	 `Lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': Naomi Snart.	ARTHUR	 (handing her something) Taste this truffle. Naomi tastes it. It's clearly delicious. She gazes around as the crane swings them out over the Hudson. The view of Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here. Naomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne.	NAOMI	 What the hell. Gotta go sometime, right? At least it won't be years of pain like mom. Just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth.	ARTHUR	 So anyway. The tours...	Arthur 
ERICA	 Where are you going?	ARTHUR	 (gets out his cellphone) Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait.					Arthur 
OLD WOMAN	 Not that one.	ARTHUR	 (offers her another) This one?	OLD WOMAN	 (shaking the tin) No. There's less beans in it.	ARTHUR	 This one?	Arthur 
ARTHUR	 (offers her another) This one?	OLD WOMAN	 (shaking the tin) No. There's less beans in it.	ARTHUR	 This one?	OLD WOMAN	 (sniffs the tin) No.	Arthur 
ARTHUR	 This one?	OLD WOMAN	 (sniffs the tin) No.	ARTHUR	 This one? She stares and thinks. Arthur puts the tin to his ear.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 No. I think I hear a mouse inside. Arthur shakes and sniffs another tin.	Arthur 
HOBSON	 I'm sure Arthur will explain. EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT The live version of Simon and Garfunkel's `The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy') is playing on speakers. Arthur and Naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording. Naomi sips her wine. Arthur throws back a whisky.	ARTHUR	 Your kids' book. What was it about?	NAOMI	 `Vlad the Inhaler'. About an asthmatic boy detective.			Arthur 
ARTHUR	 Yes.	HOBSON	 (under her breath) Oh, bollocks.					Arthur 
ARTHUR	 I ate the whole jar.	NAOMI	 (realising it's serious) Oh, man. What? What?	ARTHUR	 I'm engaged. To another Susan. Woman. Engaged to another woman. She slams her menu down.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.	Arthur 
NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)	 You're the only one who really knew me at all. The song hits a hard club mix. Arthur bursts from the back of the van in a frog outfit! The `tourists' launch into a well- rehearsed dance.	ARTHUR	 (lip syncing too) So take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space. And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 Take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face...Just take a look at me now. The song builds to a dance crescendo. A magical moment. The crowd watches. How can she say no?			Arthur 
JUSTIN	 Absolutely. Naomi turns to A WOMAN.	NAOMI	 (to a WOMAN) Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?	WOMAN	 That way. The ballroom.	NAOMI	 Bye, Justin. Naomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man.	Arthur 
NAOMI	 I know that. I'm here to give Arthur some very important news.	DOOR MAN	 Of course you are. (takes her arm) Shall we discuss this outside?	NAOMI		(SHOUTS)	 Get your hands off me! They tussle. Arthur intercedes.	Arthur 
HOBSON	 Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my use-by date.	ARTHUR	 Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this one. I need you to care for me. (holds up a pill) Now take your fish oil.					Arthur 
ARTHUR (CONT'D)		HOBSON!	 (hammering the machine) Why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off?	(SHOUTS)	 GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT... He sees that the monitor is unplugged. The cord is in Hobson's hand. It's over. Hobson's dead. Arthur sobs his heart out.			Arthur 
ARTHUR	 12. Which is... (looks at his wrist) Where's my watch gone?	NAOMI	 (looks at her watch) It's eight minutes to.	ARTHUR	 It's too late, then. Naomi hands Arthur her phone.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 I don't know her number! It's in my phone's address book in that gloop.	Arthur 
SHIT! TAXI!	 A taxi stops. Arthur feels for his pockets. Ah shit.	ARTHUR (CONT'D)	 Um, can anyone spare... (to the DRIVER) How much to St. John the Divine please?	DRIVER	 About 15 bucks...	ARTHUR	 (to the crowd) Can anyone spare $15 please?	Arthur 
DRIVER	 About 15 bucks...	ARTHUR	 (to the crowd) Can anyone spare $15 please?	DRIVER	 What about tip? You cheapskate?	ARTHUR		Arthur 
SUSAN	 No.	ARTHUR	 Wow. Wow. Well. Uh... (heads to the door) Thanks for your honesty. I don't feel so bad about calling this off. Erica steps in his way.	SUSAN	 Arthur, please. You can drink as much as you like, sneak off to Naomi. We keep the money. We live our lives. Everyone wins.			Arthur 
VIVIENNE	 Burt! Get off my son! But nothing's going to stop Burt.	SUSAN	 (louder than anyone yet)	DADDY!!!	 Susan is over Burt, brandishing a Virgin Mary statue.	BURT	 You wouldn't hurt me.	Arthur 
OW!	 INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Naomi's typing, sipping `Sprike' (fake Sprite). Beside her is a printed manuscript titled `SNART'S FAKE NEW YORK - A Bogus guide to the World's Greatest City.' On the computer screen is: `...the 1765 Irish Hair Famine swept through Manhattan, rendering every resident bald for a week.'	ARTHUR (O.S.)	 This is outrageous!					Arthur
