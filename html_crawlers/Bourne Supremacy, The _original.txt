1    EXT. MERCEDES WINDSHIELD -- DUSK                                       1

     It's raining...

     Light strobes across the wet glass at a rhythmic pace...

     Suddenly -- through the window a face -- JASON BOURNE --
     riding in the backseat -- his gaze fixed.


A1   INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT                                                A1

     On his knee -- a syringe and a gun --

     The eyes of the driver, JARDA, watching --

     BOURNE'S POV -- the passenger -- back of his HEAD -- cell
     phone rings -- the HEAD turns -- it's CONKLIN --

     BOURNE returns his stare...

     CUT TO --


2    INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                          2

     BOURNE'S EYES OPEN! -- panicked -- gasping -- trying to
     stay quiet -- MARIE sleeps.


A2   INT. COTTAGE LIVING AREA/BATHROOM -- NIGHT                            A2

     BOURNE moving for the medicine cabinet. Digs through the
     medicine cabinet. Downs something specific.

                                                                            3
3    INT./EXT. COTTAGE LIVING ROOM/VERANDA -- NIGHT
     One minute later.       BOURNE moves out onto the veranda.

     MARIE pads in. Watching him for a moment. Concerned.
     Clearly it's not the first time this has happened.

     The   y both loo   k differe   nt than last we    saw them;    his hair is
     lon   ger. She'    s a blond   e. Hippie trav    elers. Th    eir cottage

                             MARIE
                 Where were you, Jason?

                                    BOURNE
                 In the car.         Conklin up front.

                                                               2.


                          MARIE
              I'll get the book.

                            BOURNE
              No.    There's nothing new.

                           MARIE
              You're sure?
                    (he nods)
              We should still -- we should write it
              down.

                          BOURNE
              Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --               *

                          MARIE
              -- it hasn't been two years --                            *

                             BOURNE
              -- it's alwa   ys bad and it's    never                   *
              anything but    bits and piece   s anyway!                *
                    (she's    gone quiet)                               *
              You ever thi   nk that maybe i   t's just                 *
              making it wo   rse? You don't     wonder that?            *

    She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him.

                          MARIE
              We write them down because sooner or                      *
              later you're going to remember something                  *
              good.                                                     *

                          BOURNE
                    (softens)
              I do remember something good.       All the
              time. I remember you.

    She smiles.     Kisses him.   Leads him back in.

                                                                    4
4   INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT
    MARIE getting BOURNE into the bed. Turning down the light.
    Getting him settled. Waiting for that pill to kick in.
    What would he do without her?

                          BOURNE
              I'm trying, Marie, Okay?

                          MARIE
              I worry when you get like this.

                                                             3.


                            BOURNE
                It's just a nightmare.

                            MARIE
                I don't mean that.   I worry when you try
                to ignore it.

    He    hesitates. But that gets him. He knows she's right.
    And    with that opening, he's letting go. Resistance
    fol   ding. Almost childlike. She's gathering him in.
    He'   s letting her do it...

                             MARIE (CONT'D)
                Sleep.   Sleep now.

                            BOURNE
                I should be better by now.

                            MARIE
                You are better. And I think it's not
                memories at all. It's just a dream you
                keep having over and over.

                            BOURNE
                But it ends up the same.

                             MARIE
                One day it will be different. It just
                takes time.
                      (beat)
                We'll make new memories. You and me.

    Silence. She strokes his face. He gives in to her
    tenderness. He's fading. Two waifs in the dark.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

                                                                  5
5   EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY
    BOU   RNE running in the sun. A punishing pace along the
    san   d. Moving strong. Effortless. Deep into it. Focused.
    The    stunning conjunction of sun and scenery are lost on
    him   .


6   EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY                   6

    A busy market town. Fishing town. Hippie town. Lots of
    young Western faces. Rundown and happening at the same
    time.

    MARIE shopping.      Filling a bag with local produce.

                                                          4.


7   EXT. ROAD -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY                          7

    BOURNE still running, leaving the beach behind.


8   INT. COTTAGE KITCHEN -- DAY                                8

    MARIE back from the market, putting the groceries away.
    Almost done, when she stops for a moment --

    A PHOTOGRAPH. There on the windowsill. A snapshot. Jason
    and Marie on a beach. Her arms around him. As if she were
    the protector. Big smiles. Young. Alive. In love.

    MARIE smiles.


9   EXT. MAIN STREET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY                   9

    Funky busy. Colonial facades in vivid, sub-continental
    technicolor. Loud morning traffic.

    CAMERA FINDS

    BOURNE coming out of a store with a big bottle of water.
    He's just finished his run. Standing there, chugging away,
    checking the scene, when something catches his eye --

    HIS POV

    THE STREET. A SILVER CAR -- something newish -- pulling
    down the block -- can't quite see who's driving, but --

    BACK TO

    BOURNE watching this silver car. So serious he's casual.
    Nobody passing would notice, but we do: He's on alert.
    MOVING WITH HIM AS
    BOURNE follows THE SILVER CAR on foot -- natural --
    cruising the BUSY SIDEWALK -- blending into the mix --
    chugging on that water bottle and --

    UP AHEAD

    THE SILVER CAR making the corner and turning now --

    BACK TO
    BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --

                                                                      5.


     HIS POV

     THE    SILVER CA   R has   par   ked. There's a GUY -- well-dressed --
     cas   ual -- phy   sical   --    sunglasses -- call him KIRILL -- he's
     out    of the ca   r and   hea   ding across the street toward a
     bui   lding ther   e. A    TEL   EGRAPH OFFICE.

     BACK TO

     BOURNE checking his watch.            The car.   The guy.   Perimeter.


10   INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE/GOA -- DAY                                      10   *

     MR. MOHAN at his desk. He's a crisp, proper man of fifty.
     He's just been handed something --

     A PHOTOGRAPH OF MARIE -- an old passport picture.

                             MR. MOHAN
                 And your question, sir?

     KIRILL across the desk.

                             KIRILL
                 She's my sister. There's been a
                 death in the family. This is the
                 last place we know she called from.


11   INT. COTTAGE -- DAY                                                   11

     A NOTE ON THE TABLE:             "I'M AT THE BEACH"

     BOURNE has just come in -- just read the note -- balling it
     quickly. In fact, everything is quickly now, because --

     BOURNE is bailing.
     Fast. Calm. Methodical. Some exfil procedure that he's
     honed and choreographed. Packing like a machine --

     RAPID TIME CUTS
     -- BACKPACKS thrown open on the bed. -- HOUSE CASH pulled
     from a lamp base. -- CREDIT CARDS taped under the counter.


12   EXT. MAIN STREET/BANK GOA/BEACH TOWN -- DAY                           12

     KIRILL coming out of the bank. Mission accomplished.
     Heading back to the SILVER CAR. Getting in and --

                                                              6.


13    INT. SILVER CAR -- DAY (CONT)                                13

      KIRILL starting it up. Glancing around nice and easy.
      He's cool. Putting the car into gear, he makes a slow pass        *
      through the marketplace. Eyes everywhere.                         *


14    DELETED                                                      14   *


15    INT. COTTAGE -- DAY                                          15

      BOURNE -- done -- the place is stripped -- pulling on the
      backpacks -- glancing around -- one last thing -- shit, he
      almost missed it --

      THE PHOTOGRAPH -- the one of he and Marie on the beach --
      the one we saw her looking at earlier -- there it is on the
      windowsill -- jamming it into his pocket and --


A16   EXT. SIDE STREET/PARKING AREA -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY    A16      *

      KIRILL now parked and out of the car -- on the move -- on         *
      foot -- he begins a sweep of the beach.                           *


16    EXT. COTTAGE BACK DOOR -- YARD/ALLEY -- DAY (CONT)           16

      BOURNE out the back -- jogging -- keeping low -- into the
      neighborhood -- through the alleys -- nothing random about
      it, this has all been worked out and --


17    DELETED                                                      17   *

18    EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY
      Crowded with tourists -- sunbathers -- MARIE at her
      favorite spot. Talking with TWO WOMEN, laughing with them -
      - happy.


18A   EXT. BEACH/PARKING AREA -- GOA -- DAY                    18A      *

      A burly JEEP comes roaring up. BOURNE spots the SILVER            *
      CAR, parks at the other end -- takes off towards the beach.       *

                                                                  7.


19   EXT. BEACH -- GOA -- DAY                                          19   *

     KIRILL methodically making his way up the beach --                     *
     checking every blue tent -- every towel.                               *


20   EXT. BEACH -- GOA -- DAY                                          20   *

     BOURNE coming up the beach the opposite way -- one eye on              *
     KIRILL, one eye on MARIE.                                              *

     He arrives just as KIRILL looks up and sees them a                     *
     hundred yards away -- a hard stare between them -- BOURNE              *
     bends down --                                                          *

                             BOURNE
                 We gotta go, Marie.       We gotta go, now.

     Fro   m the tone    of his voice, she knows it's serious.              *
     Mar   ie grabs h   er bag. A quick goodbye to the friends.             *
     The   y hurry of   f. BOURNE uses the sunbathers as cover.             *
     KIR   ILL retrea   ts.                                                 *


21   EXT. BEACH/PARKING LOT -- GOA -- DAY                              21   *

     They reach the JEEP -- she knows the drill -- bag tossed in            *
     the back -- even as the Jeep pulls away and --                         *


22   INT. JEEP -- DAY (CONT)                                           22

     BOURNE driving.       MARIE beside him --

                                  BOURNE
                 We're blown.

     She hesitates.       One minute ago everything was fine.

                                  MARIE
                 No...     How?

                             BOURNE
                 The Telegraph office.

                             MARIE
                 But we were so careful.

                             BOURNE
                 We pushed it. We got lazy.                                 *

                                                             8.


23   EXT. BEACH/PARKING LOT -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY               23   *

     out onto the MAIN STREET -- blocked by the local traffic --       *
     pulling a HUGE AUTOMATIC PISTOL out from his travel bag.

                But you're sure?

                            BOURNE
                He was at the campground yesterday.

                hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?

     KIRILL trapped in some Main Street gridlock. Glancing back
     for a way out -- freezing suddenly, because there --

     HIS POV -- THE JEEP -- THE ALLEY -- right there -- twenty
     yards back -- a good look at BOURNE and MARIE -- as they
     disappear and --


26   EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY (CONT)                   26

     THE JEEP backing up the way it came -- BLOWING ITS HORN
     because an OLD VAN pulls in and blocks him from behind --

     He    can't get the Hyundai to the alley from where he is and       *
     it    doesn't make sense to go on foot. He checks his
     rea   rview.

      SNIPER SCOPE POV

      There! The JEEP rumbling across the bridge. No clear
      target, just the back of the full DRIVER'S SIDE HEADREST.

      KIRILL'S FINGER

      Squeezing.   Firing.

                                                                  13.


34   EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE -- DAY (CONT)                                   34

     The JEEP jerking.

     FRONT FENDER tearing into and along the guard rail --
     cement shards fill the air --

     BOURNE reaching for the wheel -- Too late!

     As the JEEP finally crashes through the flimsy guardrail --

     Plummets -- splashes hard -- begins to sink out of sight.


35   EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY (CONT)                                        35

     KIR   ILL lowers    the scop   e, takes a quick look around. He's

     sil   enced rifl   e. But p    eople are already rushing toward the
     bri   dge. Then    ... there   !

     An OLD WOMAN looking directly at KIRILL from a doorway.
     Not quite sure what. But an old Indian woman in Goa? So
     what.

     KIRILL drills her with a look.          As she sinks back inside --


36   INT. JEEP -- SINKING IN THE RIVER -- DAY/SUNSET                    36

     KIRILL scans the surface of the river under the bridge.
     Waiting.

     KIRILL with a killer's patience, waiting, almost done.

     SCOPE POV
     The surface of the water.          Unbroken.

                                                                14.


        KIRILL

        Scans his perimeter. There's the old woman again. But

                  might've wandered a little past your pay-
                  grade.

      ABBOTT rocked and trying to hide it.

                  And what are we looking for?

                              PAMELA
                  I want to know about Treadstone.

       FERRY -- BOURNE at the rail. Unchanged from India.

121       EXT. FERRY BUILDING CUSTOMS HALL -- NIGHT                   121

          NEVINS. American. A junior, C.I.A. Field Officer.
          Walking from the parking lot, talking on his cellphone.

                                   NEVINS
                    ...what can    I do? I can't. I'll call you
                    when I know    what I'm into...

                    will. Later    ...

          NEVINS hangs up and pockets the phone.    He hustles towards
          the building.


122       INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM -- DAY                              122

          The room is jumping. Agents tracking, working the phones
          and computers. PAMELA giving orders. ABBOTT watches.

                                                               33.

123   INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET                 123

      As NEVINS flashes his credentials to CARABINIERI at door,
      who gives an unimpressed shrug and lets him in.

      NEVINS takes his overcoat off, tosses it on the empty
      chair. We see a big ass .45 for just a second under his
      suit jacket.

                               NEVINS
                Alright, Mr.    Bourne, is that your name?
                      (BOURN   E nods)
                Name's Nevin   s. I'm with the US Consulate.
                Could I see    your passport?

      BOURNE, silent, hands over his passport.

                            NEVINS (CONT'D)
                So, Mr. Bourne...

      NEVINS studies Bourne's passport...

                            NEVINS (CONT'D)                            *
                What are you doing in Tangiers?

      Silence...                                                       *

                            NEVINS (CONT'D)
                      (faux friendly)
                Are you travelling alone?                              *

                                                             34.


       BOURNE stares straight ahead. NEVINS comes around the         *
       table and sits in front of BOURNE.                            *

                             NEVINS (CONT'D)                         *
                       (in his face)                                 *
                 Look, I don't know what you've done.                *
                 But, you're gonna need to play ball here.           *

       NEVINS cell starts to ring.    He shrugs an apology, turns    *
       away and answers:                                             *

                             NEVINS

123    INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET              123

       Whatever Nevins is being told, it's concerning.    BOURNE
       watching him. Knows exactly what this is.

       CLOSE ON NEVINS as he steps away, listening intently. His
       hand just starting to move toward his shoulder holster.

                             NEVINS (cont'd)
                 Okay, I'll call you right back.

       NEVINS flips shut his phone.   He reaches for his gun, even
       as he turns, and --

       BOURNE is right there in his face. WHUMP! Momentum and
       gravity reaching mutual agreement as NEVINS hits the deck.

       CARABINIERI barely clears his holster before -- CHOP --
       CHOP -- BOURNE has him down in a heap.

                                                                             35.


          BOURNE is back, silent and effective.

          FINALLY

          BOURNE -- exits the door, wedging a desk under the handle
          so it cannot be opened from the inside and calmly walks
          away like nothing ever happened --

          And now we see the old BOURNE, in his long black coat,
          purposely striding out of the building. He pauses long
          enough for the security camera to get a good look at him.

          THE RONIN returns.


125       EXT. NAPLES FERRY PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               125

          BOURNE crosses the street and approaches a man putting his
          suitcase in the trunk of a green Peugeot. BOURNE reaches
          into his bag, pulls out some cash.

          NEVINS stirring, the CARABINIERI still out. A phone starts
          to RING. Nevins' phone. Finally sitting up, he answers.

                                         NEVINS

       Dropping the car into gear, BOURNE pulls briskly away from

       Inside a hanger. Inside an office. ABBOTT watching as
       CRONIN questions NICKY. PAMELA sits on a window sill.

                              CRONIN
                  So your cover at the time was what?

                              NICKY
                  That I was an American student in Paris.

                              CRONIN
                  What exactly did your job with Treadstone
                  in Paris consist of?

       Nicky looks to Abbott. He nods that it's okay to               *
       answer. Pamela bristles at the check-off.                      *

                     CRONIN
         Health, meaning what?

                     NICKY
         Their mental health.       Because of what
         they'd been through.       They were prone to a
         variety of problems.

         What kind of problems?

                     NICKY
         Depression. Anger. Compulsive
         behaviors. They had physical symptoms --
         headaches -- sensitivity to light --

         The details? No. I mean,         I was told it
         was voluntary. I don't kno       w if that's
         true or not, but that's wha      t I was told.
               (a bit defensive)
         Look, they took vulnerable       subjects,
         okay? You mix that with th       e right
         pharmacology and some serio      us behavior

         You felt nothing? No spark? Two young
         people in Paris? Dangerous missions?
         Life and death?

         Did you?

                     NICKY
         These were killers. Conklin had them all
         jacked up. They were Dobermans.

                               KURT
                   Could be random.

                                                               44.


                             CRONIN
                 Maybe he's running.

       ABBOTT looks skeptical.

                             ABBOTT
                 On his own passport?

                             KIM
                       (the image)
                 What's he actually doing?

                             CRONIN
                 What's he doing? He's making his first
                 mistake...

       And then, from behind them --

                                NICKY
                 It's not a m   istake.
                       (every   one looks over)
                 They don't m   ake mistakes. And they don't
                 do random.     There's always an objective,           *
                 always a tar   get.                                   *

                 If he's in N   aples, on his own passport,            *
                 there's a re   ason.                                  *

       PAMELA turns to ABBOTT. A silent moment between them.
       They're in it now and they know it.

INTO

THE KITCHEN. He drops his briefcase on the table, opens
the fridge for a drink. Except what he comes out with is --

A GUN!

Wheeling around. The salaryman is JARDA.        JARDA from
Bourne's dream. But as he turns --

BOURNE behind him.   Bigger gun.     Waiting.   So ready.

                      BOURNE
          I emptied it.

                      JARDA
                (a total pro)
          Felt a little light.

                        BOURNE
          Drop it.

JARDA lets the gun fall, looks his old comrade over a beat.

But Bourne's not interested in a reunion.

                        BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
          Here...

Bourne tosses him FLEXCUFFS -- JARDA puts his hands behind
his back, turns to let BOURNE cinch them.

                        BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
          Front.    Use your teeth.

                      JARDA
                (caught scamming)
          Sorry. Old habits.

                              Sit.
BOURNE kicks over a chair.

BOURNE checking JARDA'S briefcase -- tearing through it --

                      BOURNE
          You still should've moved.

                      JARDA
          I like it here.

                       JARDA (CONT'D)
           Last time I saw you was Greece.      You had a
           good spot.

BOURNE reacts -- doesn't look over -- but realizes...

                          JARDA (CONT'D)                          *
           I had the gi   rl. I had her lined up that

           was the prob   lem.
                 (defen   sive)
           You ever do    two targets? It's tough.

BOURNE turns.   Cold.

                 (his real question)

                        BOURNE
           She wouldn't let me.
                 (beat)
           She's the only reason you're alive.

Silence.   JARDA down a peg.       Or two.

                       JARDA
           What do you want?

                          BOURNE
           Conklin.

                          JARDA
           He's dead.

BOURNE -- the gun -- right to Jarda's face --

                          BOURNE
           Try again.

                       JARDA
           Shot dead in Paris.       Dead the night you
           walked out.

                       BOURNE/PHONE
           Then who runs Treadstone?

                       JARDA
           Nobody. They shut it down. We're the
           last two. It's over...
                 (not finishing because--)

-- he's falling! -- landing hard -- BOURNE just kicked the
chair out from under him --

                                                          48.


                       BOURNE
           You're lying. If it's over, why are they
           after me?

                       JARDA
           I don't know.

                       BOURNE
           Who sent you to Greece?

                        JARDA
           A voice. A voice from the States.
           Someone new.

                       BOURNE
           Pamela Landy?

                       JARDA
           I don't know who that is.

                       BOURNE
           What's going on in Berlin?

                       JARDA
           I don't know! Why would I lie?

Silence.   BOURNE pulls back.      Unsure.

JARDA makes it to his feet.

                       JARDA (CONT'D)                           *
           What the hell did you do? You must have
           really screwed up.

BOURNE doesn't know.      He backs off.

                          JARDA (CONT'D)
           She really d   id that? Told you not to kill
           me?
                 (beat)
           I had a woma   n once. But after a while,
           what do you    talk about? I mean, for us.
           The work. Y    ou can't tell them who you
           are...

                          BOURNE
           I did.

JARDA hesitates. It's really like Bourne just told him how
much he loved her.

                       JARDA
           I thought you were here to kill me.

                                                                   49.


      Something in the way he said it.          Plus Jarda just glanced
      at his watch.

                              BOURNE
                  What did you do?

      JARDA shrugs, almost embarrassed. BOURNE looks across to
      the alarm pad Jarda hit on the way in. Voltage -- like a
      switch.

                              BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
                  You called it in?

                                     JARDA
                  I'm sorry.

                              BOURNE
                  How long? How long do I have --
                        (stopping because--)

      THE PHONE JUST STARTED RINGING -- loud -- insistent --

                                     BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D)

       AN AUTOBAHN REST-STOP.    Gas station.   Sleeping trucks.

       BACK TO

       BOURNE catching his breath -- shifting away from the pain
       in his rib -- checking his watch -- but what the hell is
       that on his sleeve? -- fuck, it's BLOOD -- JARDA's blood --


167    EXT. AUTOBAHN REST-STOP -- NIGHT                            167

       BOURNE out of the car fast -- careless -- wrong -- not even
       checking who's watching -- pulling off the shirt -- tearing
       it off -- throwing it down and --

       Standing there. In the weird light.      A big bruise ripening
       on his side. Looking around.

       It's okay.   Nobody's watching.   But, shit, man...

       Get it together.

          taking A LOCKER. Stashing A BACKPACK. Prepping the evac.

       BOURNE walking right past them -- he's got the whole thing

           A GUY carrying a briefcase toward him. Stopping for a

       BOURNE -- eyes locked on the target.   Scanning.    Waiting.

       And then, something changes. Suddenly, there's something

back in with Conklin -- PAMELA waving for a pencil.

          There was a girl in Paris. Part of the
          program. She used to handle the
          medication.

AND NOW WE STAY WITH

PAMELA -- her eyes flicker over to NICKY.

          What if we can't find her?

                             NICKY
                No.   You never worked Berlin.

       BOURNE raising the gun -- eyes gone dead -- oh, shit...

       He's so ready to kill her. NICKY starting to cry -- hands

       An hour later.          Whole new vibe.    Siege mode.     Curtains
       drawn.

       THREE DELTA DUDES parked around the room.               KURT and KIM            *
       working the phones and screens.

      The mood is dark. PAMELA, ABBOTT, CRONIN all in here,
      the "safe" zone, away from the windows --

      PAMELA turns, looking at the photo of BOURNE in Naples.           *
      Introspective.                                                    *

       KIRILL wearing headphones, listening to a BERLIN POLICE
       FREQUENCY. There's an INTERPOL "WANTED" PICTURE OF JASON
       BOURNE there on the seat. He's in play.


D193   INT. BERLIN HQ/COMMAND POST -- NIGHT                     D193

       Quiet, intense activity.     MILITARY RADIOS CHIRPING here
       and there.

       THE CAMERA FINDS

       ZORN moving through the bullpen, carrying a cup of coffee,
       heading back toward PAMELA'S OFFICE where --

       ABBOTT is leaning in the doorway. Past him, inside, we can
       see PAMELA in the midst of a tough phone conversation.
       CRONIN and THE DELTA BOSS sitting there with her.

                              ZORN
                        (the coffee)
                  Sir...

                               ABBOTT
                  Thanks.

       ABBOTT nods.   Takes a sip.   Looking beat.

                              ZORN (cont'd)
                  I have that number you wanted...

       ABBOTT hesitates -- but only a moment -- he never asked for
       a number. But he's playing along. Looking satisfied as
       ZORN hands him a slip of paper.

                              ABBOTT
                        (glancing at it)
                  She say what time I should call?

                              ZORN
                  The sooner the better.

       ABBOTT nods. Pockets the paper.     Turning back, as if it
       were nothing and --

       BOURNE is reading it.

       And we're reading in his face. That he is rocked.                     That he
       has found another bottom to the abyss.

       ZORN and ABBOTT making their way in. Zorn steering them

        street deserted, foreboding --

        THE HOTEL

        Our destiny waiting up there somehow --

           He pulls A KNIFE from his pocket.

                Maybe he just needed a place to spend the

      BOURNE coming around the other side of the hotel --

      Stepping to the left before he spots the SWAT van --

      BOURNE about-faces -- heads the other way --

      A SIDEWALK COP looks over, checks the BOURNE PHOTO print-

244   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL BRECKER -- NIGHT           244

      TEDDY huddled with the HOTEL MANAGER and A GROUP OF HIGH-

                            ABBOTT
                      (arriving breathless)
                They missed him?

                            ABBOTT
                He let her go? Great. Where's Danny?                 *
                He should head over there and debrief                *

                            TEDDY
                We don't know. They're in a room
                upstairs. I was told to wait down here.

      ABBOTT accepting that. Because he has to.   Only we see
      the fear. Turns to leave...                                    *

       MOTION -- BOURNE tearing away and --


A237   EXT. BIGGER BERLIN STREET -- NIGHT                       A237

       BOURNE slows to a walk -- TWO PATROL CARS heading his way --
       no choice -- there -- a narrow passageway between TWO
       MOVING TROLLEY TRAINS and -- SPRINTING through --

       The PATROL CARS skidding into 180's.

                                                                B237
B237   EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT
       THE RIVER SPREE lit by THE TROLLEY that's rumbling past and
       the running lights of a DOUBLE COAL BARGE up the river.

       BOURNE runs across the bridge -- going as fast as he can --
       hearing THE POLICE SIRENS swirling behind him, when --

       A THIRD AND FOURTH POLICE CAR AHEAD!

       BOURNE turns hard for a STAIRWELL, jumps the walkway curb,
       leaps up the stairs, two at a time, as --

       All FOUR COP CARS SKID to a stop.    As doors open --

                                                             87.


238   EXT. TRAM PLATFORM -- BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT              238

      A TRAM waiting as the LAST FEW PASSENGERS get on.   The
      doors seem to stay open in slow motion as --

      BOURNE appears -- makes a mad last dash --

      And he's on!

      And the doors don't close!    It's not scheduled to go yet.

      And here come the COPS!

      BOURNE off the tram -- GUNS appear --

      BOURNE runs to his left -- stops short --

      The other cops are coming this way -- SCREAMING at him --

      Not a lot of options -- BOURNE looks over the rail --

      DOWN BELOW

      A COAL BARGE passing, the prow just emerging --

      BOURNE

      On the rail and JUMPING even as the FIRST SHOT is fired --


239   EXT. DOUBLE COAL BARGE -- NIGHT                           239

      BOURNE lands hard -- stands -- voltage going up one leg --

      And they're SHOOTING at him.

      He can worry about the leg later.   He RUNS.

      Back toward them!

      The barge moving slow -- BOURNE disappears under the
      bridge.


240   EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT                               240

      Guns aimed, POLICE waiting for a clear shot.   TWO OF THEM
      DASH to watch over the other side.

                                                                88.


241      EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE -- NIGHT                             241

         Countering -- the barge going one way -- BOURNE the other --
         dodging all the super-structure on deck -- all the while
         keeping his cover overhead --

         And LEAPING to the second barge!

         And more of the same, until --

         BOURNE running out of barge --

         LEAPING back onto the BRIDGE FOOTING and --


242      EXT. BERLIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT                                242

         THE POLICE watching the barge fully emerge -- continuing
         down river -- SHOUTING IN GERMAN that he's either "in the
         water" or "hiding on the barge".

         Off they go -- down the stairs --

         Leaving the PASSENGERS on the tram blinking out in shock --

         And BOURNE -- climbing back over the rail --

         Limping back on the tram just before --

         The DOORS CLOSE -- and off it goes --


243      EXT. NEXT BRIDGE DOWN -- NIGHT                             243

      Looks out the window -- something weird about the light out
      there -- then up to see:

      MARIE -- looking at him over the back of his chair in front
      of him -- no big deal --

                               BOURNE

                    I know it's a dream.

                                   MARIE
                    You do?

                                BOURNE
                    I only dream about people who are dead.

          MARIE leans over, kisses his forehead.    Whispers --

                    God, I miss you. I don't know what to do             *
                    without you.                                         *

          BOURNE opens his eyes.

          And it's morning outside.

          And Marie is gone.

          A LITTLE GIRL smiles at him from over the back of the chair
          in front. BOURNE can't meet her gaze for long. As he
          looks back out the window --

      the smokestacks beyond. Eyes locked. Forging something
      within, one final mission, as we --

      ABBOTT coming through.       It's empty this early, but --

      Here's PAMELA, NICKY, CRONIN and the TEAM waiting to                 *
      report.

                            PAMELA
                Sorry to wake you.

      PAMELA looks to CRONIN -- him first.                                 *

Pamela waves him off, it's okay, but --

                      PAMELA
          There's something else.

Abbott can see by their faces: this hits closer to home.

                       ABBOTT
          What?

                      PAMELA
          They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the
          basement at the building where my people
          got hit the first time.

                       ABBOTT
          Oh, God...   It must have been Bourne.             *

                      PAMELA
          Did he say anything to you?

                      ABBOTT
          No... It must have been Bourne.

PAMELA, straight...

                      PAMELA
          We'll know for sure when we get the                *
          security tapes.                                    *

          But we can relax. We tracked him.     He's         *
          on a train to Moscow.                              *

ABBOTT reeling, hiding it.

                      ABBOTT
          Moscow? What the Hell's he going to
          Moscow for?

                Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his
                family. Tell them...

                            PAMELA

      They watch as he goes.

       Now we realize, she's set a trap and Abbott's walked in.
       All the same, Pamela shakes her head, wishes it wasn't
       true.

       ABBOTT at his desk, still on the phone, pouring a vodka.

                             GRETKOV
                 Leaving was a business decision.     We're
                 both rich, come enjoy it.

                             ABBOTT
                 What do you mean?

                             GRETKOV
                 Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll
                 have a brass band waiting for you.

                             ABBOTT
                 Save it for Bourne.

                                GRETKOV
                 What?

       There's a KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR -- ABBOTT simply ignores it.

                                ABBOTT
                 He left yest   erday on the night train.

      He raises the gun.

      PAMELA -- presses her lips together, closes her eyes.
      BOOM!

      She opens them.    And as CRONIN flies back through the door --

      There's ABBOTT -- dead at the desk -- he's shot himself --
      also, in a way, with some help from Bourne.

      There, in the plaza. BOURNE hobbling across the street,

      Look out!

      A BIG BLACK BMW speeding past -- followed by TWO MORE --
      all three cars with BLUE LIGHTS STROBING on the dashboards -

      Old Moscow. But not for long, there's new construction
      metastasizing all around it. BOURNE crosses the street and
      --

      HIS POV

      AN ABANDONED WOODEN HOUSE. Windows shattered and boarded
      up. Paint all but gone. Roof and gables all failing.

           TWO MOSCOW POLICE CARS PULLING U-TURNS on the BOULEVARD --     *
           whipping around to give chase and --                           *

                                                      110.


THE G-WAGON in full pursuit now and --                         *

BOURNE DRIVING -- up this curving little hill and --           *

THE TWO MOSCOW POLICE CARS starting to climb and --            *

KIRILL DRIVING and he's on the hill now --                     *

BOURNE -- bad hand on the wheel -- holding on -- trying to     *
find something in passenger seat -- TUBE SOCKS?                *

THE TWO MOSCOW POLICE CARS splitting up! -- one on Bourne's    *
ass -- the other cutting hard into A SIDE STREET, flanking     *
him and --                                                     *

BOURNE -- topping the hill -- two choices -- right or left?    *

RIGHT! -- No! -- wrong -- because down the hill there's A      *
POLICE CAR just about to angle in from THE SIDE-STREET and -   *
-                                                              *

BOURNE -- no choice -- FLOORING IT! --                         *

THE CAB -- it's a whale -- SLAM! -- knifing the front end      *
of THE POLICE CAR and --                                       *

THE POLICE CAR -- spun back! -- CRASHING AGAINST A BUILDING    *
ON THE CORNER and --                                           *

KIRILL -- right behind that guy -- swerving -- onto the        *
sidewalk -- SPARKS FROM THE WALL AS HE SCRAPES! -- hanging     *
in -- skidding into a turn down the hill and --                *

JUST MISSING THE FIRST POLICE CAR bombing right past him!      *

BOURNE -- in pain as he packs his shoulder wound with the      *
socks -- Ahead -- the street banks downhill to left and --     *

THERE! -- A BOULEVARD -- wide ride -- lots of traffic and --   *

THE CAB rocketing into the flow and --                         *

BEHIND HIM -- POLICE CAR #1 with THE G-WAGON right on his      *
ass and --                                                     *

BOURNE -- Wrists flicking the wheel.   THE CAB screaming       *
through the slower traffic and --                              *

KIRILL -- totally on it -- pedal down -- passenger window      *
open -- wind blowing -- he's got THE PISTOL in his hand --     *
closing the gap and --                                         *

THE BLACK G-WAGON -- blowing past POLICE CAR #1 and --         *

                                                                            111.


          BOURNE -- steering -- barely -- as he tears a few strips of                      *
          DUCT TAPE to finish his triage --                                                *

          BLAM! -- BLAM!! -- THE G-WAGON -- right beside him! --                           *

          BOURNE -- reacting -- what the fuck?! -- that's not a cop! -                     *
          - but no time to clock Kirill because --                                         *

          KIRILL -- shit! -- can't keep shooting -- into the oncoming                      *
          lanes -- swinging wide -- A TRUCK! -- swerving again and --                      *

          THE CAB -- wavering again -- rallying and --                                     *

          UP AHEAD -- THE BOULEVARD opens into THE RIVER BELTWAY --                        *
          big -- wide -- fast -- KREMLIN in the BG and --                                  *

          FOUR NEW POLICE CARS screaming down from RED SQUARE and --                       *

          BOURNE skidding onto THE BELTWAY -- looking for room --                          *

          -- Finding it -- open road --                                                    *

          BOURNE -- Both hands on the wheel -- He's already forgotten                      *
          about his shoulder --                                                            *

338   INT. THE TUNNEL -- DAY                                   338

      FOUR LANES -- two way -- and long -- there's --                 *

      THE CAB -- squibbing past SLOWER CARS and --                    *

      KIRILL on him -- move for move -- follow the leader and --      *

      BOURNE -- checks the rearview -- he's lost them all but the     *
      G-WAGON -- who the hell is that? --                             *

      The Heavyweights.   World Championship Belt up for grabs.       *

      KIRILL -- gaining -- nearly pulling level.                      *

      BOURNE -- nowhere to go -- that's never stopped him before -    *
      - he carves a path -- turns two lanes into three as             *
      sparks his way through a lane split --                          *

      THE G-WAGON -- roaring after him.

      BOURNE -- checks the mirror -- closer -- who the Hell is
      that guy? --

      KIRILL -- Gaining -- FIRING through his passenger window.

      BOURNE -- BRAKES --

      TUNNEL -- As the two vehicles scrape along each other --

      KIRILL -- FIRING BACK -- odd angle --

      BOURNE -- ducking for meager cover as bullets stitch
      through the roof --

      TUNNEL -- The G-WAGON crushes the CAB against the wall --
      sparks showering the windshield -- finally --

      THE CAB -- shoots ahead --

      KIRILL -- in a controlled fury --

      THE SUV -- jerking hard and right into the rear of the CAB --

      BOURNE -- trying to keep control -- spots a MAINTENANCE
      TRUCK up ahead --

      KIRILL -- banging away as his quarry straightens --

      MAINTENANCE TRUCK -- looming --

                                                   113.


BOURNE -- a hard left --

TUNNEL -- the CAB wrapping around the front of the SUV --
WHAM! -- pushing it to the right -- the cab continues --
SPINNING around the G-WAGON --

DETAILS -- front bumpers locking on rear fenders as --

TUNNEL -- The G-WAGON hurtling forward -- the CAB ass end
first -- locked together --

KIRILL -- firing into the CAB -- really unloading now --

BOURNE -- down on the floor -- a tornado overhead --

KIRILL -- slaps in a new clip -- intense --

BOURNE -- gun against his door -- just below the window        *
knob -- WHUMP-WHUMP-WHUMP --                                   *

SUV TIRE -- shredding.                                         *

KIRILL -- fights the wheel --                                  *

ANOTHER TRUCK -- looming large --                              *

BOURNE -- looking between the seats out the rear window --     *
a LANE DIVIDING PILLAR ahead --                                *

CAB -- as BOURNE sits up -- jerks the wheel to the right --    *

TUNNEL -- the cars unlock -- spin away from each other --      *

KIRILL -- focused -- taking deadly aim --                      *

BOURNE -- staring back at him -- calm -- "I know something     *
you don't know."                                               *

KIRILL -- frowns --                                            *

THE TRUCK -- swerves to reveal the PILLAR to Kirill's POV --   *

KIRILL -- eyes go wide --                                      *

WHALLOP! -- steel vs. concrete -- concrete victorious -- a     *
bone compressing, truly horrendous impact!                     *

BOURNE -- whipping the wheel --                                *

CAB -- spinning to a stop out of harm's way -- door opening    *

339       INT. TUNNEL -- DAY                                      339

          Gun ready -- BOURNE heads over.

          Ahead -- Spam in a can.   BOURNE crouches down -- looks in.

          KIRILL -- bloody, beat-to-crap -- barely alive -- but --
          trapped -- entombed alive by the metal crushed around him --

          BOURNE -- watches.   Not here to help.

          KIRILL -- looks over -- calms a moment as the two men
          consider each other --

          BOURNE looks at him long and hard.

          Kirill dies.

          And BOURNE stands -- and just walks away --

A351      EXT. MOSCOW AIRPORT TARMAC -- DAY                       A351   *

          Snow swirls. PAMELA disembarks from the G-5 (or US             *
          military plane). She is met by RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.              *


351       EXT. MOSCOW HOUSING PROJECT -- TWILIGHT                 351

          Huge, awful Soviet-era housing towers fill the horizon.

          A CITY BUS grinds to a stop. PEOPLE trundle off.    Working
          people at the end of their day. Tired. Cold.

          THE CAMERA FOLLOWS

          A GIRL. Trudging a man-made wasteland. Twenty. A proud
          little waif. Sad eyes. Home from some job. IRENA.


352       EXT./INT. PROJECT BUILDING ENTRANCE -- EVENING          352

          Grimmer up close. Rusted steel mesh over the windows.
          DRUNK TEENAGERS. A haze of cigarette smoke.

          IRENA pushing through.    Doesn't want to talk to anyone --

                                                               115.


353   INT. PROJECT BUILDING STAIRWELL -- EVENING                   353

      IRENA climbing.   A JUNKIE here.     Flickering light there.


354   INT. SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY -- EVENING                          354

      IRENA -- her key at the door. Domestic disturbance playing
      across the hall. She opens up and --


355   INT. IRENA'S APARTMENT -- EVENING                            355

      It's dark.   And she's barely through the door when --

      IRENA jumps -- chokes back a CRY --

      BOURNE is standing there -- propped there actually --
      behind her -- gun in hand -- motioning for her to be quiet --

                            BOURNE
                      (his shabby Russian)
                (Quiet. Silence. Okay?)

      IRENA nods. Scared. Gun in hand, BOURNE pushes the door
      the last few inches so it's fully closed.

                            IRENA
                (I have no money.       No drugs.   Is that what
                you want?)

      And now she can really see him. He's a disaster.
      Shivering. Bloody. Eyes more hollow than hers are.

                               BOURNE
                Sit.  Can yo   u...
                      (tryin   g to conjure the
                       Russi   an--)
                (The chair.     Have the chair.)

                            IRENA
                      (accented)
                I speak English.

      BOURNE staring at her.    Nods.    Gestures for her to sit.

                               BOURNE
                Please...

      So she does.   And here they are.

                                                                  116.


                               BOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
            Of all the p       eople in the world, you're the
            only one I h       ave anything to offer.
                  (hesit       ating)
            That's why I        came here.

                            IRENA
                      (she's terrified)
            Okay.

He'   s got some   thing bes   ide him. Somet    hing he's    taken off
the    wall. IT    'S THE PH   OTOGRAPH. The     Neski fami   ly. Same as
the    one that    was in th   e Hotel Brecker   . Mom, Da    d and Irena,
arm   s around e   ach other   , in front of t   he house.     Before it
was    abandoned   . Happy.      Smiling. Per    fect.

                        BOURNE
            It's nice.
                  (a beat)
            Does this picture mean anything to you?                          *

                        IRENA
            It's nothing. It's just a picture.

                       BOURNE
            No. It's because you don't know how they
            died.

                        IRENA
                  (he couldn't understand)
            No, I do.                                                        *

A change in BOURNE as he studies her, measures her.                Some
moment of truth is here. IRENA braces, unsure.

                               BOURNE
            I would want        to know.
                  (beat)
            I would want        to know that my mother didn't
            kill my fath       er. I would want
            to know that        she didn't kill herself.

                               IRENA
            What?

She really looks at him now.           Fear overwhelmed by
curiosity.

                        BOURNE
            I would grow up thinking that they didn't
            love me if they just left me like that.

                                                         117.


Irena making sure her eyes don't leave his.    They don't.

                      BOURNE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
          It changes things. That knowledge.
          Doesn't it?

                         IRENA
                (wary)
          Yes...

                      BOURNE
          That's not what happened to your parents.

                         IRENA
          Then what?

                      BOURNE
          I killed them.

Body blows, but he has her attention.    She wipes a tear.

                         BOURNE (CONT'D)                        *
          It was my jo   b. My first time. Your
          father was s   upposed to be alone. But then
          your mother,    she came out of nowhere...
                (a lit   tle shrug)
          I had to cha   nge my plan.
                (beat)
          You understa   nd me?
                (does    she?)
          You don't ha   ve to live like that anymore.
          Thinking tha   t.

                      IRENA
          You killed them.

BOURNE nods, that's right.

                       BOURNE
          They loved you.
                (beat)
          And I killed them.

                      IRENA                                     *
          How...how can...how can you be here and               *
          say this?                                             *

                      BOURNE                                    *
          I don't want you to forgive me.                       *

She stands suddenly. Stands because if she doesn't she'll
burst into tears. Because she knows if she starts crying
she won't be able to make sense of this.

                                                       118.


                      IRENA
          For who?                                              *
                (he doesn't answer)
          KILLED FOR WHO?

BOURNE pushes himself to his feet.    A real effort.

                      BOURNE
          It doesn't matter.     Your life is hard
          enough.

                      IRENA
          You're a liar.

                      BOURNE
          You know I'm not.

                      IRENA
          YOU'RE A LIAR!

                        BOURNE
          Look at me.

There they are.   Two people standing in a room.     Squared
off.

And now she starts crying.    Really crying.

And he's taking it.

                      IRENA
          I should kill you...if it's true you
          should die...I should kill you now!

                      BOURNE
          I can't let you do that either.                       *

                      IRENA
          Because you're afraid!

                        BOURNE
          No.
                (starting for the door)
          Because you don't want to know how it
          feels.

She hesitates.    Stunned.   He's leaving.   He's opening the   *
door.                                                           *

                      BOURNE (CONT'D)                           *
          I have to go now.                                     *

                      IRENA                                     *
          Is this really happening?                             *

                                                               119.


                            BOURNE                                      *
                      (empty)
                I'm sorry.

      And she sags.   Back into the chair, as --                        *

      THE CAMERA FINDS                                                  *

      THE PHOTOGRAPH on the table. The sound of the door                *
      closing and Irena crying, as --                                   *


356   EXT. HOUSING PROJECT PLAYGROUND -- DAY                      356

      BOURNE trudging along.    Across the snow.   He's done it.

      And he really can't take another step.

      There's a bench.   He sits down.   Out of gas.

      He just might die here. We slowly tilt up to the multi-           *
      colored Moscow tenements.                                         *

                                                         FADE OUT:      *


357   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY                                   357

      BOURNE waking up -- sitting up -- where is he? -- trying to
      get his bearings -- but it's so bright -- white walls --
      sheets -- SUNSHINE through clean windows and --

                            PAMELA (OS)
                Hello, David.                                           *

      There she is.   Standing at the foot of his bed.

                               BOURNE
                Where am I?

                               PAMELA
                Ramstein Air    Base, Germany.                          *
                      (smile   s)
                Before the w   all fell you would have woken
                up in a Russ   ian prison hospital.

      He looks around -- tries to move -- hammered by pain.

                               BOURNE
                Oh, shit...

                               PAMELA
                Careful...                                              *

                                                         120.


Long moment.   He's taking it in.   Trying to.

                      BOURNE
          Why am I alive?

                      PAMELA
          Are you disappointed?

They study each other a beat.

                      BOURNE
          I know who you are.

PAMELA nods.   Very calm here.    No sudden movements.

                      PAMELA
          Thank you for your gift.    I'm sorry about Marie.    *

                         BOURNE                                 *
          What's that?                                          *

                      PAMELA                                    *
          Do you think you can read?     Are you well           *
          enough?                                               *

She has a folder.   A PHOTOGRAPH -- Bourne's face -- stapled
to the cover.

                      PAMELA (CONT'D)                           *
          It's all in here. Treadstone.      A summary
          of your life. All of it.

He waves it off.

                      BOURNE
          Don't need it. I remember everything.
                      PAMELA
                (smiles again)
          Sounds like a threat.

                      BOURNE
          You didn't answer my question.

                         PAMELA
          Why you're a   live?
                (beat)
          You're alive    because you're special.
          Because she    kept you alive.
                (she s   miles)
          Because we w   ant you back on our side.

BOURNE silent.   But hearing it.    PAMELA leaves the file.

                                                             121.


                              PAMELA (cont'd) (CONT'D)
                  Take a look at it. We'll talk later.

      BOURNE watching her back away.     As she exits into --


358   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY                             358

      Long, sterile hallway. CRONIN and NICKY standing there
      with an AIR FORCE SENTRY assigned to guard the room.

      CRONIN and NICKY trying to play it cool, but now, as they
      get some distance down the hallway --

                              PAMELA                                  *
                        (to the sentry)                               *
                  Let's give him half an hour.                        *

                               NICKY
                         (quietly)
                  So?

                              PAMELA
                  Felt promising. It's a start.                       *

      A chill in the air. Both of them going quiet because
      there's A NURSE carrying a tray of food. She's coming
      toward us. They're walking away.

      THE CAMERA

      Staying with THE NURSE now.      Coming up the hall.

      THE SENTRY smiles -- opens the door and she enters --

                                                                359
359   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
      Empty bed.   Open window.     Bourne is gone.

      As THE MUSIC STARTS PUMPING, and we...


360   EXT. MUSEUM ISLAND BRIDGE -- BERLIN -- DAY                360   *

      Off he goes.      Disappearing into thin air...                 *

      FADE OUT.                                                       *
