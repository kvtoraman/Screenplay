ALEX (V.O.)	 It's strange.  When the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean, you never really get there.  It's always one step ahead of you.  It's like there's no present. There's no "now".  As soon as you think, "I'm here", the moment's already gone.  Either everything's in the future, or it's in the past. (beat) There's no "now".	MAN (V.O.)	 So where are you then?	ALEX (V.O.)	 I'm in the past.			Arcade 
MR. WEAVER	 We don't have to stop now...	ALEX	 (cutting him off) That's okay.  I've got a test coming up anyway.  Gotta study.	MR.

ALEX	 (offering, fixing him with a stare) Killed herself?	MR. WEAVER	 (reluctant) Yes.  Now your father...	ALEX	 He's a basket case.  You've talked to him. You know that.  He might as well be dead too.	ALEX	 (continuing) Look Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I came here.  I fine.  Really. (looking up) It's like I said.  It's just part of the past now.  It doesn't matter anymore.	Arcade 
NICK	 (to Benz) You're an idiot, you know that? What're you going to do when you get out of here?	BENZ	 I was thinking about writing for one of those Filipino mail order brides...	STILTS	 I think I saw that on the Home Shopping Network.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after Auto Accessories.			Arcade 
STILTS	 I think I saw that on the Home Shopping Network.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after Auto Accessories.	BENZ	 (giggling) Exactly.	LAURIE	 You guys are sick.	GREG	 So how'd it go?	Arcade 
GREG	 (continuing) Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.	ALEX	 (nodding) I know.	GREG	 So tell me you're okay, then.	ALEX	 I'm okay.	Arcade 
ALEX	 I'm okay.	GREG	 (smiles) Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.	GREG	 (to Alex) Hey...watch this...	NICK	 (engrossed in his game again) You making another one, Greg?	Arcade

BENZ	 Check it out...	NICK	 (excited) That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys are good.  It's supposed to be interactive. Graphics are unbelievable.	BENZ	 Yeah?  They were handing these out at Dante's.  Test marketing it or something. Gonna have a demonstration today.	STILTS	 Cool.	Arcade 
STILTS	 Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...	GREG	 (annoyed) Guys...	BENZ	 So how 'bout it?	NICK	 I'm game... (to Greg) Greg?	Arcade 
BENZ	 So how 'bout it?	NICK	 I'm game... (to Greg) Greg?	GREG	 Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.	ALEX	 And then keep on driving?	Arcade 
GREG	 Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.	LAURIE	 (nodding) I could go for that.					Arcade 
NICK	 Super computers, micro-processors... That's the future we're looking at.	DELOACH	 (looking around) So how come they're previewing it in this shit-hole?	STILTS	 If you weren't such a dick, you'd know what a cool place this was.	DELOACH	 Gimme a break, they got fucking Space Invaders here.  That's shit's for retards.	Arcade 
DELOACH	 No, but since I'm standing here, I'm noticing that you're an ugly little fuck and you're making me sick...	FINSTER	 (shaking them) Cut it out!!!	ALEX	 It's okay, Mr. Finster...	FINSTER	 No it's not. (to the boys) You guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.	Arcade 
ALEX	 It's okay, Mr. Finster...	FINSTER	 No it's not. (to the boys) You guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.	DELOACH	 (acting tough) Your place sucks.  Who gives a shit about "ARCADE" anyway?	VOICE (O.S.)	 (booming, metallic)	Arcade

ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)	 Not bad, huh?	DIFFORD	 Hi, kids. (nods) Mr. Finster...	DIFFORD	 (smooth as silk) We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.	NICK	 So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.	Arcade 
NICK	 So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.	DIFFORD	 A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point. (to everyone) What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.	NICK	 That's impossible.	DIFFORD	 (taking the bait) Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?	Arcade 
NICK	 That's impossible.	DIFFORD	 (taking the bait) Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?	GREG	 Go for it, Nick.	DIFFORD	 (indicating equipment) The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick things up inside the world...tools, weapons ... it'll feel like they're really in your hands...	Arcade 
GREG	 Go for it, Nick.	DIFFORD	 (indicating equipment) The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick things up inside the world...tools, weapons ... it'll feel like they're really in your hands...	DIFFORD	 (continuing) The goggles heighten the experience. When we said "Reality will never be the same", we weren't kidding.	NICK	 (skeptical) "Escape"?	Arcade 
DIFFORD	 (continuing) The goggles heighten the experience. When we said "Reality will never be the same", we weren't kidding.	NICK	 (skeptical) "Escape"?	DIFFORD	 In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...	BENZ	 (scoffing) Nick won't need it.	Arcade 
DIFFORD	 In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...	BENZ	 (scoffing) Nick won't need it.	DIFFORD	 You're good, eh?	NICK	 (grins) The best.	Arcade 
DIFFORD	 You're good, eh?	NICK	 (grins) The best.	NICK	 (to Difford) So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?	DIFFORD	 It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.	Arcade 
ARCADE	 I AM ARCADE. (breathing)	YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE	 WRONG MACHINE.					Arcade 
NICK	 Nick.	ARCADE	 (almost contemptuous) NICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE.	LAURIE	 (concerned) What's it doing?!			Arcade 
NICK	 So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...	ALEX	 (cutting him off) But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...	NICK	 It's nothing, okay?  Just take his car home. He'll show up.	NICK	 Don't worry about it.	Arcade 
JIM	 ...am in bed...	ALEX	 (standing back up) Yeah.					Arcade 
ARCADE	 (malevolent) HELLO, ALEX.	ALEX	 How ...					Arcade

ALEX	 Nick...	NICK  (O.S.)	 (filtered) Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...	ALEX	 (cutting him off) Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.	NICK (O.S.)	 (filtered) What the hell are you talking about?	Arcade 
NICK  (O.S.)	 (filtered) Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...	ALEX	 (cutting him off) Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.

ALEX	 (cutting him off) Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.	NICK (O.S.)	 (filtered) What the hell are you talking about?	NICK (O.S.)	 (filtered) You there?  Hello?	ALEX	 I have to talk to you.	Arcade

ALEX	 No, in person.  Now.	NICK (O.S.)	 (filtered) It's twelve-thirty!	ALEX	 I'm coming over.	ALEX	 Shit...	Arcade 
ALEX	 What's that? (as seen earlier) are blossoming on the screen.	NICK	 Isn't it amazing?  It's a sort of rest position in the game, when you're between levels.	NICK	 (continuing) They're fractals.  Visual representations of mathematic equations.  The game is totally brilliant.  I mean, look at it, it's like a DNA molecule or something...			Arcade 
NICK	 I'm in the middle of it...	ALEX	 (upset) Turn if off!	NICK	 Happy?	ALEX	 No. (frustrated) Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... (carefully) I think the game's alive somehow.	Arcade 
NICK	 Happy?	ALEX	 No. (frustrated) Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... (carefully) I think the game's alive somehow.	ALEX	 (continuing) No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".	NICK	 Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...	Arcade 
NICK	 Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...	ALEX	 (insistent) It is.	NICK	 How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.	ALEX	 So how did it know my name, then?	Arcade 
ALEX	 So how did it know my name, then?	NICK	 (shrugs) You imagined it.	ALEX	 See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick! (screaming)	I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!		Arcade 
NICK	 (shrugs) You imagined it.	ALEX	 See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick! (screaming)	I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!		NICK	 (a strained whisper) Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.	Arcade 
I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!		NICK	 (a strained whisper) Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.	ALEX	 There!	ALEX	 It turned itself back on, Nick.	Arcade 
NICK	 Benz...	ALEX	 (fatalistic) Something's happened to them.	NICK	 It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.	ALEX	 All of them?	Arcade 
ALEX	 Because I didn't know where else to go.	NICK	 (glances at a clock) It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.	NICK	 (continuing) It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?	ALEX	 (half-hearted) Sure.	Arcade 
NICK	 (continuing) It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?	ALEX	 (half-hearted) Sure.	ALEX	 If I were you, I'd think twice about playing that game again.			Arcade 
STILTS	 Sick?	ALEX	 Everybody's sick, huh? (glances at watch) It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.	STILTS	 (to Nick) What's her problem?	ALEX	 Did you play ARCADE last night?	Arcade 
ALEX	 Everybody's sick, huh? (glances at watch) It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.	STILTS	 (to Nick) What's her problem?	ALEX	 Did you play ARCADE last night?	STILTS	 Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...	Arcade 
ALEX	 (continuing) And then I started thinking...about everyone else that was at Dante's yesterday.  I drew up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ... their phones are out of order too.	NICK	 (annoyed) So what do you want me to do?	ALEX	 We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...	NICK	 No way.	Arcade 
NICK	 No way.	ALEX	 If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure. (pleading) Come on, Nick.	NICK	 Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?	STILTS	 So you guys are cutting school?  Lemme go with you.	Arcade 
NICK	 Just stay here, Stilts.	ALEX	 (dead serious) And don't watch any television.	STILTS	 Oh, okay.  Forget Twilight Zone, now we're talking Outer Limits here.  We control your horizontal, your vertical...	NICK	 Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're not back...	Arcade 
NICK	 Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're not back...	STILTS	 I'll call the National Guard.  I got it under control. (giggles) Oh, just one more thing.  Is it a supernatural thing you guys are going off to fight, or is it aliens, like Pod People and stuff like that?  Cause there's a difference, you know.  One you need garlic and silver bullets for, the other...	NICK	 (irritated) Look at me, Stilts.  Am I laughing?	NICK	 Just do what she said.  Don't watch television.	Arcade

NICK	 It doesn't necessarily mean she's...	ALEX	 (cutting him off) Let's go around back.					Arcade 
ALEX	 Nick, what do we do?!	NICK	 (realizing) No, Alex!  Alex, wait a minute...					Arcade 
NICK	 (freaked) What is it?	ALEX	 (shaking Laurie) Laurie...wake up...	LAURIE	 (voice distant) I am awake. (grins wider) Don't you see them?	NICK	 See what?	Arcade 
ALEX	 (shaking Laurie) Laurie...wake up...	LAURIE	 (voice distant) I am awake. (grins wider) Don't you see them?	NICK	 See what?	LAURIE	 Angels.  There are angels inside.	Arcade 
ALEX	 We have to turn it off, Laurie.  I'm turning it off...	GREG	 (static-laced) Alex.  Don't leave me here.	NICK	 Jesus Christ!			Arcade 
NICK	 It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...	ALEX	 (catching his drift) ...but then it hits the relay stations...	NICK	 Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.	ALEX	 (disbelief) Anywhere. (beat) We have to stop it from getting out.	Arcade 
NICK	 Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.	ALEX	 (disbelief) Anywhere. (beat) We have to stop it from getting out.	NICK	 (shakes his head) It's already out.	ALEX	 The Police, then...	Arcade 
ALEX	 (disbelief) Anywhere. (beat) We have to stop it from getting out.	NICK	 (shakes his head) It's already out.	ALEX	 The Police, then...	NICK	 Give me a break, Alex.

NICK	 Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...	ALEX	 (angry) Then where do we go?!	NICK	 I don't know.	ALEX		Arcade 
NICK	 No, but it's important and if you'd...	RECEPTIONIST	 (cutting him off) I'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment, I won't be able to help you. If you'd like, you can call his office from our courtesy phone outside and schedule one ...	NICK	 (menacing) If Difford's not out here it one minute we're calling the news and informing them that your fucking games are whispering in our ears and telling us to commit suicide. I'm talking public relations nightmare here, buddy.  Satanism, virgin sacrifices, backward messages, the whole bit.	RECEPTIONIST	 One moment please...

ALEX	 Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.	DIFFORD	 (clearing his throat) Why don't we take this into my office.					Arcade 
ALEX	 No I'm not...	NICK	 (freezing her with a stare) We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... (beat) I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?	DIFFORD	 (relieved) That's what this is all about? Tricks? Sure, I'd be happy to introduce you to ARCADE's programmer.	DIFFORD	 (continuing) Tell you what, I'll take you down to our R&D; labs right now.	Arcade

MAN	 Shit.	DIFFORD	 (clearing his throat) Albert...	DIFFORD	 (continuing) This is Nick and Alex.  They'd like to talk to you about ARCADE.  Maybe you can give them a few programmer's secrets.	ALBERT	 Yeah, sure.	Arcade 
ALBERT	 Yeah, sure.	DIFFORD	 (to Nick and Alex) Then I leave you in capable hands.	NICK	 Does that thing work?	ALBERT	 Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can. (standing) But what can I do for you?	Arcade 
NICK	 Does that thing work?	ALBERT	 Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can. (standing) But what can I do for you?	ALEX	 We're having some problems with ARCADE...	ALBERT	 Yeah, who isn't.	Arcade 
ALBERT	 If I tell you, then it's no fun.	NICK	 (harder) Just tell me the fucking riddle.	ALBERT	 Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman. (beat) Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...	ALBERT	 (continuing) The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.	Arcade

ALEX	 The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.	ALBERT	 (laughs) And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.	NICK	 Could you play ARCADE with that?	ALBERT	 Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.	Arcade 
ALBERT	 Sure.	NICK	 (quietly) Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?	ALEX	 What are you going to do?	NICK	 Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.	Arcade

ALEX	 Yes I am...	NICK	 (snapping) I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.	ALEX	 And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!	NICK	 No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.	Arcade

ALEX	 Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.	NICK	 (grins) That's what I was hoping you'd say.	NICK	 I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.	ALEX	 Got it.	Arcade
