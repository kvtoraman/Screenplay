THOMPSON	 They're out of ammo. If we don't go now-- Sheik stonewalling, Chris stands to go, fuck--	American Sniper 
MARC LEE	 And you're the secret squirrel with the cash, right?	AGENT SHEAD	 (not amused) When you were having tea with Sheik al- Obedie did he tell you he ran a network of highway bandits before AQI moved in?	CHRIS KYLE	 He left that part out.	AGENT SHEAD	 That's AQI's racket now. Your Sheik got edged out. This could be blowback.	American Sniper

Shead would rather not enter into this with them but-- he slides a white-board to reveal an AQI HIERARCHY.	AGENT SHEAD	 This is your guy here. (points to photo directly under Zarqawi) We believe The Butcher is Zarqawi's number two man. THE BUTCHER is a squat, rawboned man with eyebrows forming a grizzled line over dark bloodshot eyes.

BIGGLES	 (keys mike) Negative. Nothing yet.	CHRIS	 (to "D") Help him--	MARC LEE (OC)	 Down here. Stairs lead down into darkness. Chris follows him into--	CHRIS	 (realizes; keys mike) They're coming back up! Watch your six-- THE TUNNEL DETONATES. Dirt and debris explode at them.	American Sniper 
MARC LEE (OC)	 Down here. Stairs lead down into darkness. Chris follows him into--	CHRIS	 (realizes; keys mike) They're coming back up! Watch your six-- THE TUNNEL DETONATES. Dirt and debris explode at them.	BIGGLES	 --I can't hear you. Say again. (03.18.14)                       73.			American Sniper 
CHRIS KYLE	 Move. "D" turns from a WALK-IN FREEZER full of bloody parts.	"D"	 Big freezers. (sickened, following) Fuck--	DAUBER	 Biggles! Watch your six. Roadies on you-- He starts downing them but more seep out downrange.	CHRIS	 Pull back! Loading--	American Sniper 
CHRIS	 He's on the move. Crossing! Biggles side-steps into the street, attracting fire, downing MULTIPLE INSURGENTS as--	BIGGLES	 Got you. Got you. Go, go, go-- Chris dodges behind him, running into the next street (parallel with truck) hoping for a shot--					American Sniper 
PFC ALVAREZ	 Sir, we have armed insurgents moving this way. We need to make tracks.	MASTER CHIEF MARTIN	 (hops in Bradley) Helluva an effort here, Chief. You keep after this bastard. We'll get him. As they roar off, Chris pulls Terp over to the TRIBAL LEADER whose SHOCKING GREEN EYES reflect firelight.	CHRIS KYLE	 Tell him this boy's father was fighting for the people that butchered the clerics we found in the freezer in there.	DISTANT ALLEY	 A flutter of robes. A rusty gate pushed open by an OLD MAN. Mustafa slips past, brushing the man's shoulder in thanks. Breath in cadence with step, his head turns up-- Smoke plumes into night, their signal leading him ahead.	American Sniper 
BIGGLES (OC)	 (atop Humvee, on the .60) Fuck `em. Let's go. Shit's getting hairy.	CHRIS KYLE	 (to Tribal Leader) If I ask for your help you're the one they carve up next. I've seen it happen. A crowd of 300 chanting, as Terp translates.	TERP	 -I am the seventh son of Isaac of Abraham. This is the land of my father, and I am not afraid.- He says your evil is greater than those you fight. He calls you white satan, devil of Ramadi. Venom peels across Chris' face and makes it appear true. A Nike swoosh reflects from a near rooftop.	CHRIS KYLE	 You tell him to deliver The Butcher to us, or the devil comes back.	American Sniper 
RECEPTIONIST (OC)	 Chris Kyle, your truck is ready.	CHRIS	 (snaps-to; to Colton) Get off the floor. Right now--	MAN'S VOICE (OC)	 Excuse me, sir. A YOUNG MAN steps too close. Chris rears up, defensive.	YOUNG MAN	 Are you... "Chief" Chris Kyle?	American Sniper 
TAYA	 I hate the teams for it. I do. You're my husband and the father of my children-- but they're the ones that pull you back.	CHRIS	 (doesn't look up from his daughter) We can wait. They can't. A long pause...	TAYA (OC)	 If you think this war isn't changing you you're wrong.	TAYA	 You can only circle the flame so long. SCORE BUILDS, a steely guitar over tribal drums.	American Sniper 
BIGGLES	 Whatever, man.	CHRIS	 Ease off, don't get too close. (the van turns ahead) You gonna tell her where it came from?	BIGGLES	 Hell no! I'll tell her I got from Zales. They're laughing, off the leash, cocky and invincible.	BIGGLES (OS)	 (over radio) Still with us cookie?	American Sniper 
CHRIS	 I coulda taken him in that alley if I didn't have to save your ass--	BIGGLES	 (accelerates) Whatever helps you sleep at night.	BIGGLES	 You gonna be my best man?	CHRIS	 (still masked) Is it just me? Or other guys too?	American Sniper 
BIGGLES	 You gonna be my best man?	CHRIS	 (still masked) Is it just me? Or other guys too?	BIGGLES	 You fucking egomaniac-- A ROUND pierces the roof and goes through the floorboard-- (03.18.14)                          83.			American Sniper 
CHRIS	 Get me a shot, grandma. Biggles stomps the accelerator, whips around a corner--	A SHORT STRAIGHTAWAY	 CHRIS BLASTS 200 ROUNDS (MK48) into the van; pulverizes the thing and watches it hiss to a stop.	BIGGLES	 That should do it. COURIER bounds out of the van, diving into a building.	CHRIS	 What the fuck!? How'd he survive--	American Sniper 
BIGGLES	 Rubber junk-man's got your horseshoe. They roll out in pursuit. The Humvee pulls up. Inside--	"D"	 (into mike) --need a two block perimeter around the area. No one gets in or out. (03.18.14)                         84.					American Sniper 
BIGGLES	 Clear. An open window. Stairs climb the wall outside.	CHRIS	 (keys mike) We're headed to the roof. Secure the van.	THE VAN	 DAUBER and TONY cover MARC LEE and "D" as they open the back of the van. Inside, flats of RED CLAY TILES.	"D"	 The Butcher is building a 7-11? Marc rips off the top layer, finds: 200,000 ROUNDS AMMO.	American Sniper 
CHRIS	 (keys mike) Cover! I need cover. He's picking us off. ANOTHER SHOT inches from his head. They are being hunted.	BIGGLES	 (gargled) I'm got it. I got it-- I can walk-- Biggles pulls himself up, tilting his head forward to not choke on his own blood. With heroic effort, he stumbles to the stairs. Chris, stunned he's alive, ducks an arm--					American Sniper 
COL. JONES	 I can understand if you want to stand- down and regroup. It's up to you. The wind blows.	MARC LEE	 Lex talionis... (looks up) Eye for eye, tooth for tooth. They all agree.	CHRIS	 We're going back.			American Sniper 
MARC LEE	 Somebody left in a hurry.	CHRIS	 (keys mike) You sure we got the right address-- CANON-FIRE HITS the outer-hallway from across the street. Brrrrrb-Brrrrb!! Rounds banging with seismic force.	DAUBER (OS)	 (from hallway) Fuck-- TIME SLOWS as Chris bounds toward the door. Marc Lee gets there first, steps through it, into-- (03.18.14)                          90.			American Sniper

LONG HALLWAY	 GUNFIRE RAINS through grated windows. The hall is coming apart in dusty chunks of plaster. DAUBER and TONY are pinned between windows. MARC LEE steps to the nearest window to lay suppressive fire.			American Sniper 
MARC LEE'S MOM (VO)	 "Glory is something some men chase and others find themselves stumbling upon." REVERSE TO MARC LEE'S CASKET draped in stars and stripes. 114   EXT. FORT ROSECRANS NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY                114 A pasture of tombstones overlook the Pacific. CHRIS, with a chest-full of medals, stands with TAYA, COLTON(4) and MCKENNA(2). TAYA watches MARC'S WIFE weep as-- MARC LEE'S MOM reads his LAST LETTER HOME: (03.18.14)                          91.	MARC'S LEE MOM	 "My question is when does glory fade away and become a wrongful crusade?"					American Sniper 
TAYA	 Chris? I want to know what you thought of his letter...	CHRIS	 (slow, absent) An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles had just been shot. We were operating off emotion and-- we walked into an ambush. The kids grow quiet. The air sucked from the car.	CHRIS	 But that's not what killed him. That letter did. That letter killed Marc. (looks to her) He let go and he paid the price for it. (03.18.14)                         92. Taya turns away, wrecked. They drive in silence.			American Sniper 
CHRIS	 No.	TAYA	 (cheeks shine with tears) Then tell me why do you do it. I want to understand.	CHRIS	 I do it for you. To protect you.	TAYA	 No you don't. I'm here. Your family is here. Your children have no father--	American Sniper 
CHRIS	 Without this, there's nothing.	TAYA	 Bullshit. It's not about us anymore. You don't know when to quit. It's over- (violent) You did your part! We sacrificed enough. Let somebody else go--	CHRIS	 I could never live with myself.	TAYA	 You find a way! You have to. I need you to be human again. I need you here. (no response, she calms) If you leave again, we might not be here when you get back. It startles him and he seems suddenly alert to her suffering. He reaches for her, holding her to his chest.	American Sniper

BIGGLES	 Chris? Where are you?	CHRIS	 I'm right here just give me a minute-- (hobbles around the bed) Just blind as a bat, huh?	BIGGLES	 Yeah... It fucking blows. They're gonna fix my face though.	CHRIS	 That's good. Your face always needed a little fixing. Chris sounds upbeat but his eyes betray him.	American Sniper 
BIGGLES (CONT'D)	 (voice cracking) She's getting a raw fucking deal.	CHRIS	 No she's not. How can you say that? She's getting you. (eyes welling up) All four inches. Biggles laughs and tears roll from his vacant eye.	BIGGLES	 I'm glad this happened to me and not you. No way you could've handled it.	CHRIS	 You're probably right. There is a pause.	American Sniper 
"D"	 Squirrel cycled out. Dauber was coming back but his wife knocked him up. And if I bring home another rug my old lady'll murder my ass. Teams and shit.	CHRIS	 (nostalgic) Teams and shit.

Chris stares at him, ruined, waiting for him to take it back. SFX: A PHONE RINGS thousands of miles away as--	TAYA VOICEMAIL (VO)	 -This is Taya, I can't get to the phone so please leave a message. A car pulls into an intersection, ominous in inactivity. Dust blows sideways off its halted tires.	CHRIS MESSAGE (VO)	 It's me. I'm just calling to hear your voice. I'm missing you guys. I been thinking about some things you said.	American Sniper 
(FIRES WARNING SHOT)	 --move for the trunk you will be shot.	GATE GUARD (OC)	 Drop it! Right there! Drop him now-- They drop A MAN BOUND in blood-smeared plastic. GUARDS BARKING orders. THE DRIVER unwinds his scarf to reveal-- MESSIANIC TRIBAL LEADER (shock green eyes) who confronted Chris in Ramadi; the one tasked with finding The Butcher.	TRIBAL LEADER	 (in Arabic) Tell the devil we found his Butcher. We will protect ourselves now. He waits for response. Guns stay on him. The wind howls. (03.18.14)                         100. Beaten to within an inch of his life. Bloody plastic suffocates his mouth as he tries to inhale.			American Sniper

CHRIS	 No-- (keys mike) It came from behind us. We went the wrong way. He's south of the wall.	RANGER ONE (OS)	 (over mike) Doesn't matter. Hold your fire. We got uglies right below us-- Chris repositions himself, FACING SOUTH-- he lowers his eye to glass, bleeding sweat, aiming toward Baghdad.	CHRIS (OC)	 (into mike) I got something. 1900 yards out.	RANGER ONE (OS)	 You can't even see that far out. Hold your fire. You'll expose us all. He twitches and wobbles off-target by a city block.	American Sniper

CHRIS	 Conserve-- OPPOSITE DOOR bangs open across the roof. Chris hammers the INSURGENT but he keeps coming, drugged up. TWO MORE roll out behind him, on the same glue. This is close-quarter contact, visceral and savage.	RANGER ONE	 (into mike) Negative, negative, danger-close, they're all over us--	"D"	 Drop motherfucker! Drop! CHRIS laces bad guys. Pure brutality. They fall at his feet. Tracers light from the next roof.	"D"	 3 o'clock. Loading. Last mag.	American Sniper 
"D"	 3 o'clock. Loading. Last mag.	RANGER ONE	 (screams) QRF is stuck three blocks out.	MARINE GUNNER	 I'm out of ammo-- (03.18.14)                        105. INSURGENTS use rebar to cross from a nearby rooftop. Two ways just became three. They're swarming them. Hand-to-hand chaos. A bad way to die.			American Sniper 
CHRIS	 Do it. Call in our coordinates.	RANGER ONE	 (keys mike) This is Rio Two Bravo, requesting ordinance drop. GRID 04837959. (gunfire) I know my fucking position! They're right on top of us. Drop it! RADIO GOES STATIC, he nods, it's done.	MARINE SNIPER	 White-side! INSURGENTS crossing the gap. Chris pivots--			American Sniper

CHRIS	 Yeah, I know... Me too. I'm coming.	TAYA (OS)	 (pause) Are you alright?	CHRIS	 Yeah. I'm good.	TAYA (OS)	 Then come home. We miss you. He nods silently, listens to his kids.	American Sniper 
DOCTOR	 What's not you?	CHRIS	 I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took.

TAYA	 Aren't you and Chad going to the range?	CHRIS	 (checks watch) Not for four minutes.	TAYA	 Is that all it takes.	CHRIS	 It'll take half that. Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you. He sways with her, dancing a little two-step.	American Sniper
