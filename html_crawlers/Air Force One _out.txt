STRIKE FORCE LEADER	 (into headset/in Russian)	GO!						Air Force One 
PETROV	 (in Russian) Thank you for joining us this evening.	TRANSLATOR (V.0.)	 Tonight we are honored to have with us a man of remarkable courage, who, despite strong international criticism...	AT THE FRONT TABLE -				Air Force One 
AT THE FRONT TABLE -		TRANSLATOR	 (V.0. earpiece) Has chosen to join our fight against tyranny in forging a new world community.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the President of the United States of America...	DOHERTY	 Maybe we should consider running him for re-election instead of the U.S.	MARSHALL	 (in Russian with subtitles) Good evening and thank you.  First I would ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the Turkmenistan massacres.	Air Force One 
DOHERTY	 Maybe we should consider running him for re-election instead of the U.S.	MARSHALL	 (in Russian with subtitles) Good evening and thank you.  First I would ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the Turkmenistan massacres.	MARSHALL	 As you know, three weeks ago American Special Forces, in cooperation with the Russian Republican Army, secured the arrest of Turkmenistan's self- proclaimed dictator, General Ivan Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic reign had given new meaning to the word horror.  I am proud to say our operation was a success.	MARSHALL	 And now, yesterday's biggest threat to world peace... today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.	Air Force One 
KORSHUNOV	 Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.	MITCHELL	 The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared? (Gibbs nods) You can follow me then.	MITCHELL	 *                    I'll be giving you a brief tour, then during the flight, two members of your crew will be allowed out of the press area at a time for filming.  You will have exactly ten minutes with the President and twenty with the crew...			Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 Other way around, sir.	MARSHALL	 (realizing what he said) Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.	LARRY KING (T.V.)	 ... and your reaction to the President's trip to Moscow.  Good or bad?	SHEPHERD	 This is the part I wanted you to see.	Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.	MARSHALL	 (ignoring Shepherd) Did we tape the Duke game?	AIDE	 It's waiting on the plane.  The ending was pretty...	MARSHALL	 (interrupting) Please don't tell me.  Just for once, *                     let me be surprised.	Air Force One 
AIDE	 It's waiting on the plane.  The ending was pretty...	MARSHALL	 (interrupting) Please don't tell me.  Just for once, *                     let me be surprised.					Air Force One 
COL. AXELROD	 Welcome aboard, Mr. President.	MARSHALL	 (returns salute) Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?	COL. AXELROD	 Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?	MARSHALL	 You keep offering, one of these days I'll take you up on it. (to no one in particular) Rose and Alice back yet?	Air Force One 
COL. AXELROD	 Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?	MARSHALL	 You keep offering, one of these days I'll take you up on it. (to no one in particular) Rose and Alice back yet?	AIDE	 No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.	SHEPHERD	 Mr. President?	Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 Can I at least issue a press release objecting to the Speaker's choice of wording?	MARSHALL	 I said it's not worth the fight. (into phone) Steward, please.	SHEPHERD	 We'll just say it was in bad taste.	*                               MARSHALL		Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 We've got those Russian news guys on board and it'll look good in the papers.	MARSHALL	 C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't that enough? (off paper) New home starts are down.	MARSHALL	 Fill this with Heineken.	STEWARD	 Yes, Mr. President.	Air Force One 
MARSHALL	 (to Shepherd) Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.	SHEPHERD	 Yes, sir.	MARSHALL	 Get me the Housing Secretary...			Air Force One 
ALICE	 Back at The Fishbowl?	ROSE	 We'll talk at home. (beat) You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.	ALICE	 I know, Mom. (sees the hurt in her mom's eyes and softens) It was great... really.	ALICE	 He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	Air Force One 
ROSE	 We'll talk at home. (beat) You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.	ALICE	 I know, Mom. (sees the hurt in her mom's eyes and softens) It was great... really.	ALICE	 He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.	ROSE	 I'm sorry, honey.	Air Force One 
ROSE	 Your father never means to be so...	ALICE	 I know... (beat) But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.	ROSE	 Some kids were teasing you?	ALICE	 That's not really the point.	Air Force One 
MARSHALL	 How was... (thinks, then remembers) ...the ballet?	ALICE	 (theatrically) It was the experience of a lifetime.	MARSHALL	 How `bout a hug for the old man.	SHEPHERD	 Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.	Air Force One 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT		SHOTS FIRED! SECURE BOY SCOUT!	 (screaming out and into his lapel mike)	SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!				Air Force One 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT (V.0.)	 We have a code red, I repeat, code red. Shots fired onboard.	LT. CCL. INGRAHAMS	 (into headset microphone) Warsaw tower this is Air Force One. Declaring Emergency.	COL. AXELROD	 Ranstein Air Base, this is Air Force One Heavy. We have a code red. Shots fired onboard, request priority redirect. Please acknowledge.			Air Force One 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	 (into mike) We have Boy Scout, traveling forward.	VOICE (OVER MIKE)	 Negative... negative... they're up here too.	SECRET SERVICE AGENT	 Roger. We're going to the chute.			Air Force One 
SECRET SERVICE AGENT	 Roger. We're going to the chute.	MARSHALL	 (calling out)	ROSE! ALICE!		DOWN THE CORRIDOR -		Air Force One 
MARSHALL	 But...	SECRET SERVICE AGENT	 (cutting him off) Two... THREE. GO!	REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY				Air Force One 
COT. AXELROD	 (into mike) Ramstein/Air Force One: Emergency pod has been deployed. I repeat, emergency pod has been deployed.	RANSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER	 This is Ramstein. Acknowledged. We are picking up the homing beacon and deploying search and rescue.	COT. AXELROD	 Copy Ramstein. We are dropping to five thousand feet, beginning final approach.			Air Force One 
ROSE	 And my husband?	GIBBS	 The secret service did their job, ma'am. The President is safely off the plane. (to Korshunov) But that still leaves us plenty to bargain with.	ROSE	 Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people...	GIBBS	 Follow me, ma'am.	Air Force One 
LEE	 Twenty minutes?	V.P. CHANDLER	 You heard me. (points to an aide) You. Congress and cabinet heads.	AIR FORCE COLONEL	 Madame Vice-President?	V.P. CHANDLER	 Yes?	Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 That's all that matters. Thank god the President got of f the plane.	ROSE	 Yes... thank God. (to caldwell) You there... Caidwell, right? What's on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat, then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.	MAJOR CALDWELL	 (hushed) I don't want to get anybody here excited, but if we can get out of this room, I can get us to safety.	SHEPHERD	 We're thirty five thousand feet up.	Air Force One 
ROSE	 Yes... thank God. (to caldwell) You there... Caidwell, right? What's on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat, then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.	MAJOR CALDWELL	 (hushed) I don't want to get anybody here excited, but if we can get out of this room, I can get us to safety.	SHEPHERD	 We're thirty five thousand feet up.	MAJOR CALDWELL	 Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if we can somehow get to a lower altitude, the rear loading ramp on the baggage deck is equipped with parachutes in case of an engine failure. Now we can either wait for a political resolution, or try to resolve this thing ourselves.	Air Force One 
VLAD	 Get on the floor, now!	VIAD	 (wonderment) The President.	MARSHALL	 That's right, asshole.	*                               VLAD		Air Force One 
SERGE	 I know you're in there. Come on out. (a few beats) Okay. Have it your way.	KORSHUNOV (O.S.)	 (calling down) Serge?					Air Force One 
MAJOR CAL DWELL	 We're not getting out that way.	KORSHUNOV	 Admirable, but you're wasting your time. (beat) Mrs. Marshall, would you and your daughter please come here.	KORSHUNOV	 Now, or he dies, please.	ROSE	 Come on, Alice.	Air Force One 
ROSE	 Leave my daughter alone.	KORSHUNOV	 Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? (beat, he chuckles) But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...	ROSE	 What do you know of my husband?	KORSHUNOV	 I know he left you behind.	Air Force One 
MT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -		MARSHALL	 (hushed urgency) Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?					Air Force One 
V.P. CHANDLER	 My intention is not to escalate the situation, but it's a contigency that must be considered. Hang on... (to Aide) What?	AIDE	 The switchboard says that someone called in claiming to be the President, then she heard gunfire.	DEAN	 Could be some crank watching CNN.			Air Force One 
AIDE	 No sir. Trace confirms the call is Coming from a White House staff cellular account.	V.P. CHANDLER	 Put it through down here. (into phone) Hang on, Toni.	V.P. CHANDLER	 What's going on in the background?	DEAN	 Max, get me Willis.	Air Force One 
ALICE	 I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.	ROSE	 I know, sweetie. I know. (beat) You're being very brave.					Air Force One 
V.P. CHANDLER	 Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?	MARSHALL	 Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that. (somewhat resigned) I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. (beat) We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?	YES SIR.      CHANDLER		MARSHALL	 flow, is there a rescue operation under way or not?	Air Force One 
KORSHUNOV	 *                     Please tell me your name.	MITCHELL	 (frightened) Maria... Maria Mitchell.	KORSHUNOV	 And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.			Air Force One 
KORSFL3NOV (V.0.)	 I'll give you a few minutes to think about that one and then we'll try again. Perhaps soon I will choose somebody important.	MARSHALL	 (to himself) She was important.					Air Force One 
ROSE	 That was war.	KORSHUNOV	 So is this. (beat) Come now, you're upsetting the little one.	ALICE	 The woman you shot. She was my friend.	KORSHUNOV	 That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?	Air Force One 
VOICE	 (through static) Chief Mechanic, 87th Air. How can I help you?	MARSHALL	 You can talk me through an emergency fuel dump.					Air Force One 
GIBBS	 Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.	KORSHUNOV	 (to Zedeck) Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.					Air Force One 
GIBBS	 Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.	KORSHUNOV	 No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe. (beat) The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and... (holding up Maria Mitchell's press kit) refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.					Air Force One 
ZEDECK	 We have the hostages, we're getting more fuel.	KORSHUNOV	 He's already killed three of us, and we haven't even seen him. He's also shown that he can hurt us. I need to think. (looks at Serge) What the hell are you doing up here?					Air Force One 
SECRETARY	 The fax machines.	MARSHALL	 (dismissive) No good. I said they disabled the communications system.	SECRETARY	 No. I thought about this, Mr.	MARSHALL	 (to Caldwell) Get `em ready. (to secretary) You... come with me.	Air Force One 
SECRETARY	 No. I thought about this, Mr.	MARSHALL	 (to Caldwell) Get `em ready. (to secretary) You... come with me.	MAJOR CALDWELL	 Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.	MARSHALL	 Got it.	Air Force One 
ALICE	 (to Korshunov) He didn't leave us.	KORSHUNOV	 You are a resilient man, Mr.	KORSHUNQV	 You must forgive the tape, but we were starting to feel outnumbered...			Air Force One 
KORSHUNOV	 You'll do it?	MARSHALL	 Yes, I'll do it. (broken) Just leave my family alone.	KORSHUNOV	 Good. Good.	KORSHUNOV	 Bring him the phone...	Air Force One 
MARSHALL	 Someday, you'll regret my nature.	KORSHUNOV	 You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness. (beat) You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to					Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 Sir...	MARSHALL	 Call Petrov... (to Rose) I'll be back.	ROSE	 Both of you.			Air Force One 
COL. CARLTON	 They've changed their bearing. (into headset) Air Force One. Air Force One.	FIGHTER PILOT #1	 Sir, this new bearing. We're headed for Iraq, sir.					Air Force One 
SHEPHERD	 A MiG? Where the hell are we?	MARSHALL	 They're flying a protection formation. (beat) Call D.C. Find out what's going on.					Air Force One 
ROSE	 I love you. I just wanted you to know that.	MARSHALL	 I love you too. (beat) We're going to make it.	ALICE	 My school play's Tuesday night.	MARSHALL	 I promise.	Air Force One 
TOWER	 Romeo Tango Zulu, do you copy? Do you have the President?	KC-LO PILOT	 We copy. Stand by... (beat) Tower?	TOWER	 Tower, here.	KC-LO PILOT	 This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.
