ANDREW WALSH	 So how are we this morning?	ABEL	 (gives a smile and nod)	ANDREW WALSH	 Well I woke up feeling very good about this.	ABEL	 Really? They both take a look at their watches.	A Most Violent Year 
ANDREW WALSH	 Of course.	JOSEPH	 And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction? 8	JOSEPH (CONT'D)	 No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever.			A Most Violent Year 
ANNA	 So it's a go?	ABEL	 (he gives a nice nod yes)	ANNA	 Congratulations.			A Most Violent Year 
ABEL	 You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done?	BEAT COP	 (looks back dumbfounded)	ABEL	 Did you fingerprint or anything?	BEAT COP	 No need, these guys always wear gloves.	A Most Violent Year 
ANDREW WALSH	 Our trucks. They are being robbed.	A.D.A. LAWRENCE	 (he looks over at DEPUTY	LANGE)		ANDREW WALSH	 We have a serious security issue.	A Most Violent Year 
ANNA	 Where were you?	ABEL	 (looking to the dog) A lot of help you were.	ANNA	 Abel? They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. His feet are bleeding all over the walkway.			A Most Violent Year 
SALES STUDENT ALEX	 Why?	ABEL	 Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable. Just then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD FRONT DESK) comes to the door.	STANDARD FRONT DESK	 They need you.			A Most Violent Year 
ABEL	 Yes. EXT. ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house. CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with something in her hand. ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions.	ANNA	 Catherine... Catherine. Katie! She drops the mail. And goes right up to her daughter.	CATHERINE	 Mommy. As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little hands. ANNA is besides herself.			A Most Violent Year 
ANDREW WALSH	 He's been wanting to talk to you for days.	ABEL	 (under his breath) Jesus. ABEL gets up to go out. As ANDREW shuffles to leave ANNA	STOPS HIM:		ANNA	 Andrew can I talk to you for a minute. ABEL leaves and they stay.	A Most Violent Year 
ABEL	 I would have come to see you.	BILL O'LEARY	 That's alright. You've got bigger things to worry about. (Long pause) So, I can't have this situation with your guys continuing.	ABEL	 My guys.	BILL O'LEARY	 Your drivers.	A Most Violent Year 
ABEL	 I know.	ANDREW WALSH	 How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for.	ABEL	 I said I wouldn't do it. They sit for a long beat.	ANDREW WALSH	 I'm not sure we are in a position to say that.	A Most Violent Year 
ANNA (CONT'D)	 May I speak with you for a minute.	A.D.A. LAWRENCE	 (thinks, then) Yeah. They walk away from the others down the driveway a stretch.	ANNA	 I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party.	A.D.A. LAWRENCE	 I understand, and I'm sorry. But we are coming in. She turns a little on him.	A Most Violent Year 
PETER FORENTE	 Congratulations.	ABEL	 Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.)	PETER FORENTE	 Well, good luck. ABEL stands up ready to go.	ABEL	 Thank you for seeing me. I want more than this...	A Most Violent Year 
ANNIE	 The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! This stings. He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. But he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling again.	ABEL	 First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again!	ANNA	 Stop!! They both look over and ANNA is standing there. A calmness suddenly falls down on all of them.			A Most Violent Year 
ANDREW WALSH	 We need to find him... Lawrence needs him. INT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY ABEL stands outside the door for a very long beat then finally knocks. JULIAN'S wife, LUISA, opens the door. She gestures him in. He enters the apartment and looks around. She gestures for him to sit. He chooses a seat right across from her. He stares at her for a beat. Then for the first time we hear him speak Spanish. (This whole conversation is in Spanish)	ABEL	 Thank you for letting me in.	LUISA	 Of course. ABEL moves his chair closer. It's meant to be, and is a bit threatening.			A Most Violent Year 
ABEL	 I'll get it done. And it won't be as a cheat.	ANNA	 (Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about...	ABEL	 You stole from me! This stops her in her tracks. And eventually a little smile comes across her face. She comes way down and almost delivers this line in a whisper.			A Most Violent Year
