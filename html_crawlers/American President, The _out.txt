JANIE	 The 10:15 event's been moved inside to the Indian Treaty Room.	SHEPHERD	 (to Janie) The 10:15 is American Fisheries?	JANIE	 Yes, sir. They're giving you a 200-pound halibut.	SHEPHERD	 Janie, make a note. We need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish.	American President, The 
JANIE	 Of course, sir.	SHEPHERD	 (to the AGENT at the elevator) Hey, Cooper.	AGENT COOPER	 'Morning, Mr. President.	JANIE	 Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning.	American President, The 
LEWIS	 You skipped the whole paragraph.	SHEPHERD	 (to Janie) And Monday morning it is.	LEWIS	 "American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society"...and then nothing. You dumped the whole handguns paragraph.	SHEPHERD	 This is a time for prudence, Lewis.	American President, The 
STAFFER (LAURA)	 Thank you, sir.	SHEPHERD	 (to JANIE) I should send her some flowers.	JANIE	 You already did, sir.			American President, The 
JANIE	 --the museum trip. I'll go get it.	SHEPHERD	 (to JANIE) What time does she get home today?	JANIE	 Three-twenty.	SHEPHERD	 How's my afternoon look?	American President, The 
ROBIN	 I didn't truly appreciate it until I came back and discovered that America isn't a great society.	LEWIS	 (to ROBIN) He dumped a whole section.	SHEPHERD	 Now there's a thing hanging out there.	ROBIN	 Not a great society, sir?	American President, The 
LEWIS	 See?	SHEPHERD	 (re: a memo he's been looking at) A.J., did you get one of these?	SHEPHERD	 It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control.	ROBIN	 Are they blaming the President for global warming? (continuing; to SHEPHERD) Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. These people are outta control.	ROBIN	 Are they blaming the President for global warming? (continuing; to SHEPHERD) Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point.	LEWIS	 What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions.	LEWIS	 We haven't really tried.	American President, The 
LEWIS	 We haven't really tried.	SHEPHERD	 Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon? (to an AIDE) Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him the President's--	MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)	 Aaagh!	KODAK (O.S.)	 Sorry! Sorry, my fault. (to the AIDE) Never mind.	American President, The 
MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)	 Aaagh!	KODAK (O.S.)	 Sorry! Sorry, my fault. (to the AIDE) Never mind.	KODAK	 Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.	SHEPHERD	 You all right?	American President, The 
SUSAN	 It was aggressive, and we should stand by every--	LEO	 This isn't the guy who needed us four years ago, Susan. He's incredibly popular. He's gonna win re-election in a walk, and he could give a shit what we stand by! If the President passes the most important piece of environmental legislation in history, and does it despite our negative endorsement, our political weight in the future will rank somewhere below the Save the Spotted Owl Society. (beat) I'm bringing in some help.	SUSAN	 We don't need another environmental expert to confirm what every other environmental expert--	LEO	 Not an environmental expert, a professional political strategist. We're playing hardball with Andrew Shepherd, and we need a heavy bat.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 Try it like this and lose that.	ROBIN	 (entering) David Sasser from the Times called and wanted to know what the White House felt was a great society.	LEWIS	 What did you tell him?	ROBIN	 I told him I couldn't speak for the President, but for my money: Bermuda.	American President, The 
ROBIN	 (continuing) My God. (beat) I can't believe I said that. (beat) Mr. President, that was an incredibly thoughtless remark. I would never dream of insulting you or the memory of your wife.	SHEPHERD	 That's okay, forget it. (to JANIE) What time is it?	JANIE	 It's 3:45, sir.	SHEPHERD	 I'm gonna go over and say hi to Lucy.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 I'm not comfortable with the "really old" part, but everything else you said was true.	LUCY	 (reading the cover) "Understanding the Constitution."	SHEPHERD	 Your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the Constitution this week.	LUCY	 You talked to Mr. Linder?	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 Luce, take a look at this book. This is exciting stuff. It's about who we are and what we want. Read what it says on the first page.	LUCY	 (reading) "Property of Gilmore Junior High School."	SHEPHERD	 The next page.	LUCY	 (reading) "We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union..."	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 The next page.	LUCY	 (reading) "We, the People, of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union..."	SHEPHERD	 See? Grabs you right off the bat. It's a page-turner.	LUCY	 I can't wait.	American President, The 
JANIE	 You will, Mr. President.	AGENT #2	 (sotto) Liberty is moving.	SHEPHERD	 It's about time.	SHEPHERD	 Maybe we should try to steal her. Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that.	American President, The 
A.J.?		SHEPHERD	 Listen, Robin said something to me today that I'm sure she wouldn't have said it if...I mean, she wasn't saying it to me, I realize... (beat) Ah, never mind. Have a good night.	SHEPHERD	 A.J., when we're out of the office and we're alone, you can call me Andy.	SHEPHERD	 I mean you were the best man at my wedding, for crying out loud. Call me Andy. (laughing off the suggestion) Whatever you say, Mr. President. (continuing) Have a good night, sir.	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 (to the GUARD) Hi, my name's Sydney Ellen Wade.	SUSAN	 He just needs your driver's license.	SYDNEY	 (handing him her license) I'm from Virginia.			American President, The 
SUSAN	 He just needs your driver's license.	SYDNEY	 (handing him her license) I'm from Virginia.	SUSAN	 He doesn't care.	SYDNEY	 (to the GUARD) I'm here for a meeting with Mr. MacInerney.	American President, The 
SUSAN	 He doesn't care.	SYDNEY	 (to the GUARD) I'm here for a meeting with Mr. MacInerney.	SUSAN	 He doesn't need to know that.	SYDNEY	 (to the GUARD) Forgive me, this is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality.	American President, The 
SUSAN	 He doesn't need to know that.	SYDNEY	 (to the GUARD) Forgive me, this is my first time at the White House. I'm trying to savor the Capra-esque quality.	SUSAN	 He doesn't know what Capra-esque means.	GUARD	 (to SUSAN) Yeah, I do. Frank Capra, great American director -- It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. (handing SYDNEY and SUSAN their laminated passes) Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia. Knock 'em dead.	American President, The

(handing SYDNEY and SUSAN their laminated passes) Sydney Ellen Wade of Virginia. Knock 'em dead.	SYDNEY	 Thanks.			American President, The 
EDUCATION SECRETARY	 I know the proposal only scratches the surface, but it's the least we can do.	SHEPHERD	 We're already doing the least we can do, but I can't think of anything better, so we'll go with this for now. (to HUD SECRETARY) Jerry, say hello to Linda for me. And if I don't see you again, have a good Thanksgiving.	HUD SECRETARY	 Thank you, Mr. President.	SHEPHERD	 How're we doing?	American President, The 
JANIE	 Yes, sir.	SHEPHERD	 (exited) Janie, this is unprecedented. I don't know what to do with myself.	JANIE	 Mr. MacInerney asked me to remind you to pop your head in on--	SHEPHERD	 The GDC meeting. Right.	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 You're right. I haven't read it. If someone had asked me yesterday, I'd have told them the Quebec Conference was made up of six professional hockey teams. But what I do know is that it's time for the President to run for president again. Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and I'm certain he's told the President exactly what I'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration...	SUSAN	 (to SYDNEY) It's really time to--	SYDNEY	 Susan, I promise you, the White House Chief of Staff will not let us leave here until he's broken the bad news. (pause) I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although not about Michigan and California. The President has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent. (continuing) The President is willing to go it alone on this, but he's asking for, and frankly he's expecting, the full support of the GDC.	SYDNEY	 The President's expecting our full support?	American President, The

VOICE (O.S.)	 Let's take him out back and beat the shit out of him.	SHEPHERD	 Couldn't be better. (to the GROUP) I apologize for the interruption, but A.J. asked me to stop and say hello. You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by any chance, would you?	SYDNEY	 Mr. President, I'm...don't know what to say. I'm speechless.	SHEPHERD	 All evidence to the contrary.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 You got a second?	SYDNEY	 (quietly) Of course.	SHEPHERD	 I thought maybe we might have a word in private. Someplace a little less intimidating. (calling) Janie?	JANIE	 Yes, sir.	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 (quietly) Of course.	SHEPHERD	 I thought maybe we might have a word in private. Someplace a little less intimidating. (calling) Janie?	JANIE	 Yes, sir.	SHEPHERD	 (to SYDNEY) This is my personal assistant, Janie Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms. Wade into the rec room. I'll be there in a second.	American President, The 
JANIE	 Yes, sir.	SHEPHERD	 (to SYDNEY) This is my personal assistant, Janie Basdin. Janie, would you show Ms. Wade into the rec room. I'll be there in a second.	JANIE	 (to SYDNEY) This way...			American President, The

SHEPHERD	 Are you under the impression that I'm mad at you?	SYDNEY	 (pause) Well...	SHEPHERD	 Sydney, seldom does a day go by that I'm not burned in effigy.	SYDNEY	 Not by a professional political operative standing 30 feet from the Oval Office.	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 With all due respect, Mr. President, who's gonna stop me?	SHEPHERD	 Well, if you go through that door, the United States Secret Service. That's my private office. (pointing) You need to go out that way.	SYDNEY	 (beat) Ah.			American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 Well, if you go through that door, the United States Secret Service. That's my private office. (pointing) You need to go out that way.	SYDNEY	 (beat) Ah.					American President, The 
SYDNEY	 (into phone) Richard...Richard, it wasn't funny. I acted like a college freshman at a protest rally.	BETH	 Tell him the part about walking out the wrong door.	SYDNEY	 Oh God, I forgot about that. (back into phone) No, Richard...Richard, I don't want to hear your Andrew Shepherd imitation...			American President, The

BETH	 I wanna hear it.	SYDNEY	 I'm hanging up now, Richard... Tonight? I was gonna go to bed early and wake up when there's a new president.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 Uh, hi, is this Sydney?	SYDNEY	 (into phone) Leo?	PHONE VOICE	 No, this is Andrew Shepherd.	SYDNEY	 Andrew Shepherd. (back in the phone) You're hilarious, Richard. You're a regular riot.	American President, The 
PHONE VOICE	 No, this is Andrew Shepherd.	SYDNEY	 Andrew Shepherd. (back in the phone) You're hilarious, Richard. You're a regular riot.	SHEPHERD	 Uhh...this isn't Richard, it's Andrew Shepherd.	SYDNEY	 Oh, really. Well, I'm so glad you called, because I forgot to tell you today what a nice ass you have. I'm also impressed that you were able to get my phone number, considering I don't have a phone. Good night, Richard.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 Listen, do me a favor. Hang up the phone.	SYDNEY	 (beat) What?	SHEPHERD	 Hang up the phone. Then dial 456-1414. When you get the White House operator, give her your name and tell her you want to speak to the President.			American President, The 
SYDNEY	 (to herself) This isn't happening to me.	BETH	 What's going on?	SYDNEY	 (to herself) It's not possible I did this twice in one day.			American President, The

SYDNEY	 No, sir, of course not. I mean -- yes, you can call me anytime you want -- this is fine. Right now is fine. When I said "of course not," I meat that...You know what? The hell with it -- I'm moving to another country.	SHEPHERD	 (smiling) What did you mean when you said you don't have a phone.	SYDNEY	 I just moved to Washington over the weekend, and my apartment isn't ready yet. This is my sister's apartment. Come to think of it, how did you get this number?	SHEPHERD	 (beat) How did I get the number. That's a reasonable question. I don't know. Probably the FBI.	American President, The

SHEPHERD	 I'm gonna have a very nice woman named Marsha Bridgeport call you. She's the White House Social Director, and she'll help you with anything you want. Now when she calls you and tells you her name is Marsha Bridgeport, it'll help if you give her the benefit of the doubt.	American President, The 
LEWIS	 George Jarrett. He's ours. Solid "yes."	KODAK	 I don't believe it. (to an INTERN) You. New guy. "Jarrett, Democrat, Minnesota." Slide his name on over to "for." (to Lewis) We just had his name laminated under "Undecided." How'd you get the fence pole out of his butt?	LEWIS	 I wish I could take credit. He just said, "Lewis, I support the President a hundred percent ." Not the bill, the President.	LEWIS	 We're gonna win this in a walk. It's like a kissing booth at a carnival. Give us a vote, get a photo-op with number 63.	American President, The 
DAVID	 (into phone) Carol, it's David in Sydney Wade's office. I want to confirm her lunch with the Congressman.	SYDNEY	 (into phone) We could do with a little party leadership, Mike.

REPORTER (LLOYD)	 (to the camera) I'm standing here with Senate Minority Leader Robert Rumson, just one of the many guests arriving at what, for a few hours at least, is a non-partisan White House. Senator, the latest public opinion survey shows the President with approval ratings that would make him all but unbeatable, come next November. Is there a Republican who can mount a serious challenge, and are you that candidate?	RUMSON	 Lloyd, it's a long time till next November. Right now, I'm just looking forward to a pleasant evening.

SYDNEY	 Sure. It's nice to see you again.	ESTHER	 (affectionately) Sydney, the President told me about how you two met. I think it's priceless.	SYDNEY	 I don't know what happened. One minute I was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader. The next minute I had a date.	ESTHER	 Men like being insulted by women. It makes them feel loved. Don't ask me why.	American President, The

SYDNEY	 On the mouth.	BETH	 (exasperated) Where in the White House?!	SYDNEY	 In the dish room.	BETH	 The dish room?	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 I just came over here to tell you why I can't see you anymore.	SHEPHERD	 (to COOPER) Thanks, Coop.	SYDNEY	 Look, I know you've had a tough day.	SHEPHERD	 Not as tough as some. You want a drink? Lemme take your coat.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 I asked if--	SYDNEY	 (of course she is) That's not the issue--	SHEPHERD	 Well, I tell you what. Let's make it the issue. Let's try something new, 'cause I know that most couples, when they're first getting together, are inclined to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool.	SYDNEY	 You're not most people.	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 You have a plan? Don't make me wait. You're on a roll. SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area. SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks.	SHEPHERD	 (speaking up) Okay. You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President. It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason I know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and I know what a big step that was for you. So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down. When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen.	SHEPHERD	 (continuing) Perhaps I didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the "Slow Down" plan.	SYDNEY	 You explained it great.	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 You explained it great.	SHEPHERD	 (pause) Are you nervous?	SYDNEY	 No.	SHEPHERD	 Good. My nervousness exists on several levels. Number 1 -- and this is in no particular order -- I haven't done this in a pretty long time. Number 2: Any expectations you might have, due to the fact that I'm, you know...	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 Exactly, thank you. Just so you remember that's a political distinction that comes with the office. I mean, if Eisenhower were here instead of me he'd be dead by now. And number three...	SYDNEY	 (gently) Andy...	RUMSON (V.O.)	 Does New Hampshire want traditional American values back in the White House?	CROWD	 Yes!!	American President, The 
SYDNEY	 Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President, thank you for taking the time to go over those fossil fuel numbers. I'll just get my coat, and be on my way.	SHEPHERD	 (to LEWIS) What's the situation?	LEWIS	 They're camped out at every exit.	SYDNEY	 Who? Who's camped out?	American President, The 
ROBIN	 No diversion.	SHEPHERD	 (to SYDNEY) We'll have somebody take you home.	LEWIS	 Okay. Good. Now, the press statement.	SHEPHERD	 (to SYDNEY) Sydney, when you leave here, you're gonna run into reporters and photographers. Your picture's gonna be taken every day, and you're gonna be asked questions every day. Answer them, don't answer them -- it's entirely up to you. The White House has no official position except to say "no comment."	American President, The

Your picture's gonna be taken every day, and you're gonna be asked questions every day. Answer them, don't answer them -- it's entirely up to you. The White House has no official position except to say "no comment."	ROBIN	 No comment?	SHEPHERD	 The White House doesn't comment on the President's personal life.	American President, The 
SHEPHERD	 I tell you what, Lewis, we just did.	LEWIS	 But, sir... (the meeting's over) Thank you, Mr. President. (continuing) Sydney. Esther'll be in my office. You take your time.	SYDNEY	 Thanks, A.J.	SHEPHERD	 I'm sorry about all this. We'll do it better next time.	American President, The 
STU	 It's a demonstration outside the Department of Commerce. The picture's old, and a lot of the faces are obscured by the smoke, but this is Sydney right there in front.	RUMSON	 (staring at the photo) Oh man...tell me the smoke is coming from what it looks like it's coming from.	STU	 Yes, sir -- it's burning flag.	RUMSON	 (singing softly) "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas..."	American President, The 
STU	 Yes, sir -- it's burning flag.	RUMSON	 (singing softly) "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas..."					American President, The 
SYDNEY	 (into phone) I understand, Congressman...Of course you need to deliberate. I know the fact that there isn't any heavy industry in your district doesn't make this decision any easier. But we met three weeks ago, and at the end of that meeting you said that you were leaning our way but that you wanted to sleep on it. Since I haven't heard from you since then, the only conclusion I can reach is that you haven't slept in 21 days.	DAVID	 (to SYDNEY) Ask him about his position on stateboard for Hawaii.

LEWIS	 Sydney was at a protest rally where they burned a flag.	SHEPHERD	 (pause) Today?	LEWIS	 About 13 years ago.	ROBIN	 Outside the Department of Commerce. Anti-apartheid.	American President, The 
ROBIN	 Outside the Department of Commerce. Anti-apartheid.	SHEPHERD	 Let me see if I've got this: The third story on the news tonight was that someone I didn't know 13 years ago, when I wasn't President, participated in a demonstration where no laws were being broken in protest of something that so many people were against it doesn't exist anymore? (beat) Just out of curiosity, what was the fourth story?	LEWIS	 See, I think it's important, when we deal with it, that we--	SHEPHERD	 Don't deal with it.	American President, The
