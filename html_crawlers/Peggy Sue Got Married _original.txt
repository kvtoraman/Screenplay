	To be inserted after Dolores/Peggy scene and to replace the
	goodbye to Richard scene.

	INT. SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

	Empty except for Richard who sits alone in a study warren,
	surrounded by books. Peggy approaches. Be puts down the book
	he's reading. He smiles.

				RICHARD
		You know, Peggy, there's so many
		things to look forward to in the
		future.

	Peggy leans over and kisses him, sadly, on the forehead.

				PEGGY
		I came to say goodbye.

				RICHARD
		Goodbye? Where're you going? What
		about our partnership? I'm making
		real progress with the microchip.

				PEGGY
		You were meant to  You're one of
		those fortunate people that good
		things happen to.

				RICHARD
		So are you. You've got a vision.

				PEGGY
			(manic)
		Vision? I'm a walking anachronism!
		I've upset my parents. I miss my
		kids. I could be trapped here
		forever! And poor Charlie...I got
		pregnant on my 18th birthday and we
		had to get married. Tomorrow's my
		birthday! I've got to get out of
		here now.

				RICHARD
		Did you break up with Charlie?

				PEGGY
		Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big
		gamble. I've loved him for a long,
		long time.

				RICHARD
		Okay. Why don't we do something
		visionary. Change your destiny,
		Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and
		marry me.

				PEGGY
			(slamming down book)
		No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married!
		Case closed. I don't want to marry
		anybody. Goodbye Richard.

				RICHARD
		Wait! I'll go with you!

				PEGGY
		You can't. You're going to
		be Valedictorian.
