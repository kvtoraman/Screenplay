IRVING ROSENFELD	 Are you dressing him like you're dressing me now?	EDITH GREENSLY	 (shakes her head) No, what are you thinking? This isn't all about you, you know that.

RICHIE DIMASO	 Hey, look, I never laid a hand on her, all right? Is that what this is about?	EDITH GREENSLY	 (British accent) Well technically, that's not true.	RICHIE DIMASO	 Look, we never had sex ok? I just --			American Hustle 
IRVING ROSENFELD	 You shouldn't have done that. Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and messed up looking very angry.	RICHIE DIMASO	 How's that? You bothered now? (no answer) Alright, don't make a thing of it.	EDITH GREENSLY	 You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't like that.			American Hustle 
RICHIE DIMASO	 No, it's for the Mayor. It would be a sign of disrespect to the sheik if the mayor didn't take it himself. It's for you Mayor. Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.

American Hustle 
EDITH GREENSLY	 (whispers to Richie) Just stop it, ok	RICHIE DIMASO	 (whispers to Edith) He's gotta take it himself, okay?	CARMINE POLITO	 I don't know what the fuck that is but it's weird you understand?	CARL ELWAY	 Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.	American Hustle 
CARMINE POLITO (CONT'D)	 I'm very interested in meeting the Sheik. You let me know when THAT could happen! Thank you, have a good day. Carmine leaves the room. Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has ruined it.	CARL ELWAY	 (leaving) Irving! You better come get him.	RICHIE DIMASO	 (stares at Irv) Go out there and get him right now.	CARL ELWAY	 Help me get him back!	American Hustle

IRVING ROSENFELD	 Yeah.	SYDNEY PROSSER	 (British accent) Would you like to meet Lady Edith Greensly? Irving looks stunned as he slowly clasps her extended hand.	SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)	 (British accent) I have royal banking connections in London. I'd love to help you with your loan but of course I have to be very selective.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 That was fucking fantastic.	American Hustle 
BUSINESSMAN	 Rebecca, hold on. You're Edith right?	SYDNEY PROSSER(V.O.)	 He told me to tell my friends I had (in British accent) London banking connections	BUSINESSMAN	 I'm Jim. I'm her employer. Listen - - she told me you can get me a line of credit. I know you have banking connections in London, England.	SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)	 And after that...say "no" a lot until the guy is hooked. Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman chases after them.	American Hustle 
BUSINESSMAN	 Becky tell her! I've never missed a check!	EDITH GREENSLY	 (walking away)	NO!		SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)	 It was almost scary how easy it could be to take money from desperate people.	American Hustle 
IRVING ROSENFELD	 -- and every deal I take, I close. However, my fee is non refundable, just like my time.	MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO	 (filling out paper work) I want to thank you very much Irving for seeing me. Sorry I'm so nervous. Richie reaches for his top button to adjust it.

EDITH GREENSLY	 You couldn't see his eyes. He had no eyes. It was like, did he make it?	MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO	 (laughing) Do they sell hats like that? Where do they come from?

I give you five and you give me fifty right back, right? Please. Please don't reject me. Give a guy a chance.	MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)	 Zurich? You got an office in Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris?	IRVING ROSENFELD	 If you could excuse me for one second?	American Hustle 
MORT PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO	 You may be from England, Edith, but you're not royal and you have no banking connections and that's a felony. How long is that? That's 3- 5 years I think.	EDITH GREENSLY	 (about the handcuffs) Hey! Not so tight!	IRVING ROSENFELD	 Oh really? That's interesting. I don't even know your real name. Richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face.	RICHIE DIMASO	 Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet you. Richie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving.	American Hustle 
IRVING ROSENFELD	 I can't leave Danny. I'll lose custody.	SYDNEY PROSSER	 You have to take me away! We have to leave! (sobbing) What are you saying?! Oh my god.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 What are you doing?! Please! Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her apartment. Irving follows.	SYDNEY PROSSER	 I can't believe this is happening.	American Hustle 
IRVING ROSENFELD	 Don't say I don't love you because that's bullshit!	SYDNEY PROSSER	 (sobbing) This is bullshit. You are bullshit. We are bullshit. She starts sobbing, shaking.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 Please don't do this.	SYDNEY PROSSER	 I just never thought you were conning me.	American Hustle 
IRVING ROSENFELD	 Don't say that.	SYDNEY PROSSER	 (cries) I'm gonna do these four busts, these four cons, to get us out of this. Not just me, but us. And I'm gonna get really close with Richie, the cop, in case we need to use him, if we need another move.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 We don't need another move. We need four busts, and we're done.	SYDNEY PROSSER	 We are going to need another move, trust me. And you're going to be thanking me. (shifts to British accent) The key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe and I want to believe that we were real, and I want to believe that a man could want me. And I'm gonna take all of that heartbreak, and all of that sorrow, and I am going to use it. And I'm going to make Richie think that I want him, and that I like him, and I'm going to be very convincing -- And I'm pissed at you. Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.	American Hustle

Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her like this before.	SYDNEY PROSSER (CONT'D)	 Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like him a lot. From the feet up right -- baby? Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.	American Hustle 
SYDNEY PROSSER	 If you could not call him `stupid' which he's isn't, he's smarter than you. Last I checked he's in control here and we work for him now so be nice. Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him. He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him in.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 (stares at her, upset) OK, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone					American Hustle 
EDITH GREENSLY (CONT'D)	 I wanted to introduce you to Robert Spencer. We're advising the Sheik together. She looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand.	RICHIE DIMASO	 (catching up) Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor to the sheik.					American Hustle

Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith,	CARL ELWAY (CONT'D)	 I want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of New Jersey today. The rebuilding of Atlantic City. Richie looks over at Irving and Sydney and mouths the word	American Hustle 
CARMINE POLITO	 (giving speech) The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to paint this during the Depression. Why can't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City?	RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)	 He worked with all the unions. He was the leader of the State Assembly. And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs. 80   -- FLOOR OF STATE ASSEMBLY -- Carmine huddles with other       80 STATE LEGISLATORS, horsetrading and then poses for a picture with other members of the State Assembly.	RICHIE DIMASO (V.O.)	 But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem. So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time. And to me that meant corrupt			American Hustle 
IRVING ROSENFELD	 You gotta knock the Mayor, the Speaker of the State Assembly -- you gotta knock him off of his fucking feet. He's gotta feel like he's out of his league. What you're offering, this deal, I mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country. A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City -- are you fuckin' kidding me? That's gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check. And that's why this meeting isn't happening, because to get millions, you need millions. Edith listens intently.	EDITH GREENSLY	 (shrugs) We already did it.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 (stunned) What? Irv studies Richie and Edith.	EDITH GREENSLY	 We got the bureau to park 2 million for three days -- we got the account numbers.	American Hustle

CARMINE POLITO	 Oh, they're to fucking die for, those clams. I haven't been there in a while. I like that place.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 Carmine -- can I call you Carmine? You know, Carmine -- (catches his breath) My fuckin' heart's going from running down the stairs -- I'm not used to running. There's a lotta green grass in that hotel room up there, alright? And all the deals would float through you. You get a serious piece on both ends. You do with that what you will. I live in the real world, I am a family man, I got mouths to feed and everything. But, you know, we just...we gotta grease you directly. No middlemen, no bullshit. It's the Arab way.	CARMINE POLITO	 Yeah, look, I understand. It's a great opportunity. It's just I got a little thrown by going to have a meeting with somebody who ended up not being there, so --			American Hustle 
EDITH GREENSLY	 I just find it rather shocking that's all.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 I get to handle two wives with one dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn out, she keeps her mouth shut, she sees that my work is legitimate, I get to keep my kid, and I get to keep (pointing at Richie) that fucking wife happy. Both wives happy.

IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)	 What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic? But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand. Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.					American Hustle

ROSALYN ROSENFELD	 I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but you know that in real life, I was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan. So I will tell Pete.	IRVING ROSENFELD	 (holding his head) OK.	ROSALYN ROSENFELD	 (pointing with cigarette between fingers) The power of intention Irving. The power of intention.
