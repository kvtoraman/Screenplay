          I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, 
          I'd like to request that I be the 
          attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like 
          to request that it be myself who is 
          assigned to represent --
               (she stops)
          "That it be myself who is assigned 
          to represent"? ...Good, Jo, that's 
          confidence inspiring.

                      GIBBS
          Jo, come on in.

                      JO
          Thank you, sir.

                      GIBBS
          Captain West, this is Lt. Commander 
          Galloway. Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.

                      JO
          Yes sir.
               (to WEST)
          Captain, I appreciate your seeing me 
          on such short notice.

                      WEST
          I understand there was some trouble 
          over the weekend down in Cuba.

                      JO
          Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
          Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
          and Private Louden Downey, entered 
          the barracks room of a PFC William 
          Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
          died at the base hospital 
          approximately an hour later. The NIS 
          agent who took their statements 
          maintains they were trying to prevent 
          Santiago from naming them in a 
          fenceline shooting incident. They're 
          scheduled to have a hearing down in 
          Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                      LAWRENCE
          What's the problem?

                      JO
          Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
          poster marines and Santiago was known 
          to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
          that it sounded an awful lot like a 
          code red.



                      WEST
               (under his breath)
          Christ.

                      JO
          I'd like them moved up to Washington 
          and assigned counsel. Someone who 
          can really look into this. Someone 
          who possesses not only the legal 
          skill, but a familiarity with the 
          inner workings of the military. In 
          short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
          that... I be the one who, that it be 
          me who is assigned to represent them.
               (beat)
          Myself.



                      WEST
          Joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
          cup of coffee.

                      JO
          Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

                      WEST
          Joanne, I'd like you to leave the 
          room so we can talk about you behind 
          your back.

                      JO
          Certainly, sir.



                      WEST
          I thought this Code Red shit wasn't 
          going on anymore.

                      LAWRENCE
          With the marines at GITMO? Who the 
          hell knows what goes on down there.

                      WEST
          Well lets find out before the rest 
          of the world does, this thing could 
          get messy. What about this woman?

                      LAWRENCE
          Jo's been working a desk at internal 
          affairs for what, almost a year now.

                      WEST
          And before that?

                      GIBBS
          She disposed of three cases in two 
          years.

                      WEST
          Three cases in two years? Who was 
          she handling, the Rosenbergs?

                      GIBBS
          She's not cut out for litigation.

                      LAWRENCE
          She's a hall of an investigator, 
          Jerry --

                      GIBBS
          In Internal Affairs, sure. She can 
          crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
          best of 'em, but when it comes to 
          trial work --

                      WEST
          I know. All passion, no street smarts. 
          Bring her back in.




                      WEST
               (continuing)
          Commander, we're gonna move the 
          defendants up here in the morning.

                      JO
          Thank you, sir.

                      WEST
          And I'll have Division assign them 
          counsel...

                      JO
               (beat)
          But... not me.

                      WEST
          From what I understand from your 
          colleagues, you're much too valuable 
          in your present assignment to be 
          wasted on what I'm sure will boil 
          down to a five minute plea bargain 
          and a week's worth of paper work.

                      JO
          Sir --

                      WEST
          Don't worry about it. I promise you, 
          division'll assign the right man for 
          the job.

                                                     CUT TO:

















                      KAFFEE
               (calling out to the 
               team)
          Alright, let's get two!




                      SECOND BASE
          Sorry!

                      KAFFEE
          Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  
          Just look the ball into your glove.




                      SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
          Sorry!

                      KAFFEE
          You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep 
          your eyes open, your chances of 
          catching the ball increase by a factor 
          of ten.




                      SPRADLING
          Kaffee!

                      KAFFEE
          Let's try it again.

                      SPRADLING
          Kaffee!!

                      KAFFEE
               (turning)
          Dave. You seem upset and distraught.

                      SPRADLING
          We were supposed to meet in your 
          office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
          the McDermott case. You're stalling 
          on this thing. Now we got this done 
          and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 
          I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
          yardarm.

                      KAFFEE
          A yardarm?
               (calling out)
          Sherby, does the Navy still hang 
          people from yardarms?

                      SHERBY
               (calling back)
          I don't think so, Danny.

                      KAFFEE
               (back to SPRADLING)
          Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy 
          hangs people from yardarms anymore.
               (back to the field)
          Let's go, let's get two!



                      SPRADLING
          I'm gonna charge him with possession 
          and being under the influence while 
          on duty. Plead guilty and I'll 
          recommend 30 days in the brig with 
          loss of rank and pay.

                      KAFFEE
          It was oregano, Dave, it was ten 
          dollars worth of oregano.

                      SPRADLING
          Yeah, well your client thought it 
          was marijuana.

                      KAFFEE
          My client's a moron, that's not 
          against the law.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Ow. That had to hurt.
               (calling out)
          Way to keep your head in the play, 
          Lester. Walk it off!

                      SPRADLING
          I've got people to answer to just 
          like you, I'm gonna charge him.

                      KAFFEE
          With what, possession of a condiment?

                      SPRADLING
          Kaffee --

                      KAFFEE
          Dave, I've tried to help you out of 
          this, but if you ask for tall time, 
          I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                      SPRADLING
          You won't got it.

                      KAFFEE
          I will get it. And if the MTD is 
          denied, I'll file a motion in liminee 
          seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
          in advance, and after that I'm gonna 
          file against pre-trial confinement, 
          and you're gonna spend an entire 
          summer going blind on paperwork 
          because a Signalman Second Class 
          bought and smoked a dime bag of 
          oregano.

                      SPRADLING
          B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.

                      KAFFEE
          C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted 
          duty.

                      SPRADLING
          I don't know why I'm agreeing to 
          this.

                      KAFFEE
          'Cause you have wisdom beyond your 
          years. Dave, can you play third base?

          Sam, how's the baby?

                      SAM
          I think she's ready to say her first 
          word any day now.

                      WHITAKER
          How can you tell?

                      SAM
          She just looks like she has something 
          to say.



                      KAFFEE
          Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

                      WHITAKER
          I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
          so I won't force you to come up with 
          a bad one.

                      KAFFEE
          Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of 
          you.

                      WHITAKER
          Sit-down, this first one's for you.



                      WHITAKER
               (continuing)
          You're moving up in the world, Danny, 
          you've been requested by Division.




                      KAFFEE
          Requested to do what?



                      WHITAKER
          Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine 
          corporal named Dawson illegally fires 
          a round from his weapon over the 
          fenceline and into Cuban territory.

                      KAFFEE
          What's a fenceline?

                      WHITAKER
          Sam?

                      SAM
          A big wall separating the good guys 
          from the bad guys.

                      KAFFEE
          Teachers pet.

                      WHITAKER
          PFC William Santiago threatens to 
          rat on Dawson to the Naval 
          investigative Service. Dawson and 
          another member of his squad, PFC 
          Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's 
          room, tie him up, and stuff a rag 
          down his throat. An hour later, 
          Santiago's dead. Attending physician 
          says the rag was treated with some 
          kind of toxin.

                      KAFFEE
          They poisoned the rag?

                      WHITAKER
          Not according to them.

                      KAFFEE
          What do they say?

                      WHITAKER
          Not much. They're being flown up 
          here tomorrow and on Thursday at 
          0600 you'll catch a transport down 
          to Cuba for the day to find out what 
          you can. Meantime, go across the 
          yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne 
          Galloway. She's the one who had 'em 
          brought up here. She'll fill you in 
          on whatever she has. Any questions?

                      KAFFEE
          The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in 
          the morning, sir?

                      WHITAKER
          It seems important to Division that 
          this one be handled by the book, so 
          I'm assigning co-counsel. Any 
          volunteers?

                      SAM
          No.

                      WHITAKER
          Sam.

                      SAM
          I have a stack of paper on my desk --

                      WHITAKER
          Work with Kaffee on this.

                      SAM
          Doing what? Kaffee'll finish this up 
          in four days.

                      WHITAKER
          Do various... administrative... you 
          know... things. Back-up. Whatever.

                      SAM
          In other words I have no 
          responsibilities whatsoever.

                      WHITAKER
          Right.

                      SAM
          My kinda case.

          Hi.

          I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to

          I'm lead counsel. This is Sam

                      KAFFEE
          Going on nine months now.

                      JO
          And how long have you been out of 
          law school?

                      KAFFEE
          A little over a year.

                      JO
               (beat)
          I see.

                      KAFFEE
          Have I done something wrong?

                      JO
          No. It's just that when I petitioned 
          Division to have counsel assigned, I 
          was hoping I'd be taken seriously.



                      KAFFEE
               (to JO)
          No offense taken, if you were 
          wondering.

          Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally 
          considered the best litigator in our 
          office. He's successfully plea 
          bargained 44 cases in nine months.

                      KAFFEE
          One more, and I got a set of steak 
          knives.

                      JO
          Have you ever been in a courtroom?

                      KAFFEE
          I once had my drivers license 
          suspended.

          Commander, from what I understand, 
          if this thing goes to court, they 
          won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
          priest.

                      JO
          No. They'll need a lawyer.

          Dawson's family has been contacted.

          that?

          Sure, if you feel like it.



                      JO
          One of the people you'll be speaking 
          to down there is the barracks C.O., 
          Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've 
          heard of him.

          He's been in the papers lately. He's 
          expected to be appointed Director of 
          Operations for the National Security 
          Counsel.



                      JO
          These are letters that Santiago wrote 
          in his 8 months at GITMO --

          I know that one.

                      JO
          He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet 
          commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his 
          senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody 
          was listening. You with me?

                      KAFFEE
          Yes.

                      JO
          This last letter to the Naval 
          investigative Service --



                      JO
               (continuing)
          -- where he offers information about 
          Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting 
          in exchange for a transfer, was just 
          a last ditch effort.

                      KAFFEE
          Right. Is that all?

          Lieutenant, this letter makes it 
          look like your client had a motive 
          to kill Santiago.

                      KAFFEE
          Gotcha.
               (beat)

          Write that down.
               (to JO)
          Am I correct in assuming that these 
          letters don't paint a flattering 
          picture of marine corps life in 
          Guantanamo Bay?

          Yes, among other --

          And am I further right in assuming 
          that a protracted investigation of 
          this incident might cause some 
          embarrassment for the security counsel 
          guy.

                      JO
          Colonel Jessep, yes, but --

          Pretty impressive, huh?

                      JO
          You're gonna have to go deeper than 
          just --

                      KAFFEE
          Commander, do you have some sort of 
          jurisdiction here that I should know 
          about?

                      JO
          My job is to make sure you do your 
          job. I'm special counsel for Internal 
          Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty 
          much in your face. Read the letters. 
          You're not under any obligation, but 
          I'd appreciate a report when you get 
          back from Cuba.

          Sure.

          Marine Barracks, Rifle Security 
          Company Windward, Second Platoon 
          Delta. I am writing to inform you of 
          my problems with my unit here in 
          Cuba and to ask for your help. I've 
          fallen out on runs before for several 
          reasons such as feeling dizzy or 
          nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen 
          back about 20 or 30 yards going down 
          a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
          grabbed me and pushed me down the 
          hill. Then I saw all black and the 
          last thing I remember is hitting the 
          deck. I was brought to the hospital 
          where I was told I just had heat 
          exhaustion and was explained to by 
          the doctor that my body has trouble 
          with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. 
          I ask you to help me. Please sir. I 
          just need to be transferred out of 
          RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T.

          Sir, Santiago is a member of Second 
          Platoon, Delta.

                      JESSEP
          Yeah, well, apparently he's not very 
          happy down here at Shangri-La, cause 
          he's written letters to everyone but 
          Santa Claus asking for a transfer. 
          And now he's telling tales about a 
          fenceline shooting.

          Matthew?

                      MARKINSON
          I'm appalled, sir.

                      JESSEP
          You're appalled? This kid broke the 
          Chain of Command and he ratted on a 
          man of his unit, to say nothing of 
          the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and 
          it would appear that he can't run 
          from here to there without collapsing 
          from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's 
          going on over at Windward, Matthew?

                      MARKINSON
          Colonel, I think perhaps it would be 
          better to hold this discussion in 
          private.

                      KENDRICK
          That won't be necessary, Colonel, 
          I'll handle the situation.

                      MARKINSON
          The same way you handled the Curtis 
          Barnes incident? You're doing 
          something wrong, Lieutenant this --

                      KENDRICK
          My methods of leadership are --

                      MARKINSON
          Don't interrupt me, I'm still your 
          superior officer.

                      JESSEP
          And I'm yours, Matthew.



                      JESSEP

          I want to know what we're gonna do 
          about this.

                      MARKINSON
          I think Santiago should be transferred 
          off the base. Right away.

                      JESSEP
          He's that bad, huh?

                      MARKINSON
          Not only that, but word of this 
          letter's bound to get out. The kid's 
          gonna get his ass kicked.

                      JESSEP
          Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose 
          you're right. I suppose that's the 
          thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a 
          better idea. Let's transfer the whole 
          squad off the base. Let's -- on second 
          thought -- Windward. The whole 
          Windward division, let's transfer 
          'em off the base. Jon, go on out 
          there and get those boys down off 
          the fence, they're packing their 
          bags.
               (calling out)
          Tom!



                      ORDERLY
          Sir!

                      JESSEP
          Got me the President on the phone, 
          we're surrendering our position in 
          Cuba.

                      ORDERLY
          Yes sir!

                      JESSEP
          Wait a minute, Tom.



                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          Don't call the President just yet. 
          Maybe we should consider this for a 
          second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit 
          balling here -- but maybe we as 
          officers have a responsibility to 
          train Santiago. Maybe we as officers 
          have a responsibility to this country 
          to see that the men and women charged 
          with its security are trained 
          professionals. Yes. I'm certain I 
          once read that somewhere. And now 
          I'm thinking that your suggestion of 
          transferring Santiago, while 
          expeditious, and certainly painless, 
          might not be in a manner of speaking, 
          the American way. Santiago stays 
          where he is. We're gonna train the 
          lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
          doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
          report, I'm gonna blame you. Then 
          I'm gonna kill you.

                      KENDRICK
          Yes sir.

                      MARKINSON
          I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

                      JESSEP
          Matthew, I believe I will have that 
          word in private with you now. Jon, 
          that's all. Why don't you and I have 
          lunch at the "O" club, we'll talk 
          about the training of young William.

                      KENDRICK
          Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear 
          any suggestions you have.

                      JESSEP
          Dismissed.



                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          Matthew, sit, please.



                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          What do you think of Kendrick?

                      MARKINSON
               (beat)
          I don't know that --

                      JESSEP
          I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. 
          But he's an awfully good officer, 
          and in the end we see eye to eye on 
          the best way to run a marine corps 
          unit. We're in the business of saving 
          lives, Matthew. That's a 
          responsibility we have to take pretty 
          seriously. And I believe that taking 
          a marine who's not yet up to the job 
          and packing him off to another 
          assignment, puts lives in danger.

          We go back a while. We went to the 
          Academy together, we were commissioned 
          together, we did our tours in Vietnam 
          together. But I've been promoted up 
          through the chain with greater speed 
          and success than you have. Now if 
          that's a source of tension or 
          embarrassment for you, well, I don't 
          give a shit. We're in the business 
          of saving lives, Captain Markinson. 
          Don't ever question my orders in 
          front of another officer.

                      JO
          No, thank you, I can't throw and 
          catch things.

                      KAFFEE
          That's okay, neither can they.

                      JO
          I wanted to talk to you about Corporal 
          Dawson and Private Downey.

                      KAFFEE
          Say again?

                      JO
          Dawson and Downey.

                      KAFFEE
               (beat)
          Those names sound like they should 
          mean something to me, but I'm just 
          not --

                      JO
          Dawson! Downey! Your clients!

                      KAFFEE
          The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and 
          Downey.
               (beat)
          Right.
               (pause)
          I've done something wrong again, 
          haven't I?

                      JO
          I was wondering why two guys have 
          been in a jail cell since this morning 
          while their lawyer is outside hitting 
          a ball.

                      KAFFEE
          We need the practice.

                      JO
          That wasn't funny.

                      KAFFEE
          It was a little funny.

                      JO
          Lieutenant, would you feel very 
          insulted if I recommended to your 
          supervisor that he assign different 
          counsel?

                      KAFFEE
          Why?

                      JO
          I don't think you're fit to handle 
          this defense.

                      KAFFEE
          You don't even know me. Ordinarily 
          it takes someone hours to discover 
          I'm not fit to handle a defense.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Oh come on, that was damn funny.




                      JO
          I do know you. Daniel AlliStair 
          Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston 
          Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel 
          Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate 
          and Attorney General, of the United 
          States, died 1985. You went to Harvard 
          Law on a Navy scholarship, probably 
          because that's what your father wanted 
          you to do, and now you're just 
          treading water for the three years 
          you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, 
          just kinda layin' low til you can 
          get out and get a real job. And if 
          that's the situation, that's fine, I 
          won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
          that if this case is handled in the 
          same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
          Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
          handle everything else, something's 
          gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
          doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
          Downey to spend any more time in 
          prison than absolutely necessary, 
          because their attorney had pre-
          determined the path of least 
          resistance.



                      KAFFEE
          Wow.
               (beat)
          I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

                      JO
          I don't think your clients murdered 
          anybody.

                      KAFFEE
          What are you basing this on?

                      JO
          There was no intent.

                      KAFFEE
          The doctor's report says that Santiago 
          died of asphyxiation brought on by 
          acute lactic acidosis, and that the 
          nature of the acidosis strongly 
          suggests poisoning.
               (beat)
          Now, I don't know what any of that 
          means, but it sounds pretty bad.

                      JO
          Santiago died at one a.m. At three 
          the doctor was unable to determine 
          the cause of death, but two hours 
          later he said it was poison.

                      KAFFEE
          Oh, now I see what you're saying.  
          It had to be Professor Plum in the 
          library with the candlestick.

                      JO
          I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.

                      KAFFEE
          Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania 
          Avenue. It's a big white house with 
          pillars in front.

                      JO
          Thank you.

                      KAFFEE
          I don't think you'll have much luck, 
          though. I was assigned by Division, 
          remember? Somebody over there thinks 
          I'm a good lawyer. So while I 
          appreciate your interest and admire 
          your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty 
          much handle things myself.

                      JO
          Do you know what a code red is?



                      JO

          Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson,

          Second Platoon, Delta.

                      KAFFEE
          Someone hasn't been working and 
          playing well with others, Harold.

          Sir, yes sir!

                      DOWNEY
          Sir, PFC Louden Downey.

          I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam

          Is this your signature?

                      DAWSON
          Yes sir.

                      KAFFEE
          You don't have to call me sir.
               (to DOWNEY)
          Is this your signature?

                      DOWNEY
          Sir, yes sir.

                      KAFFEE
          And you certainly don't have to do 
          it twice in one sentence. Harold, 
          what's a Code Red?

                      DAWSON
          Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary 
          engagement.

                      KAFFEE
          What does that mean, exactly?

                      DAWSON
          Sir, a marine falls out of line, 
          it's up to the men in his unit to 
          get him back on track.

                      KAFFEE
          What's a garden variety Code Red?

                      DAWSON
          Sir?

                      KAFFEE
          Harold, you say sir and I turn around 
          and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, 
          Kaffee. Garden variety; typical. 
          What's a basic Code Red?

                      DAWSON
          Sir, a marine has refused to bathe 
          on a regular basis. The men in his 
          squad would give him a G.I. shower.

                      KAFFEE
          What's that?

                      DAWSON
          Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel 
          wool...

                      SAM
          Beautiful.

                      KAFFEE
          Was the attack on Santiago a Code 
          Red?

                      DAWSON
          Yes sir.

                      KAFFEE
               (to DOWNEY)
          Do you ever talk?

                      DAWSON
          Sir, Private Downey will answer any 
          direct questions you ask him.

                      KAFFEE
          Swell. Private Downey, the rag you 
          stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was 
          there poison on it?

                      DOWNEY
          No sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Silver polish, turpentine, anti-
          freeze...

                      DOWNEY
          No sir. We were gonna shave his head, 
          sir.

                      KAFFEE
          When all of a sudden...?

                      DOWNEY
          We saw blood drippinq out of his 
          mouth. Then we pulled the tape off, 
          and there was blood all down his 
          face, sir. That's when Corporal Dawson 
          called the ambulance.




                      KAFFEE
               (to DAWSON)
          Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

                      DAWSON
          No sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Were you there when the ambulance 
          got there?

                      DAWSON
          Yes sir, that's when we were taken 
          under arrest.




                      SAM
               (to DAWSON)
          On the night of August 2nd, did you 
          fire a shot across the fenceline 
          into Cuba?

                      DAWSON
          Yes sir.

                      SAM
          Why?

                      DAWSON
          My mirror engaged, sir.

                      KAFFEE
               (to SAM)
          His mirror engaged?

                      SAM
          For each American sentry post there's 
          a Cuban counterpart. They're called 
          mirrors. The corporal's claiming 
          that his mirror was about to fire at 
          him.

                      KAFFEE
          Santiago's letter to the NIS said 
          you fired illegally. He's saying 
          that the guy, the mirror, he never 
          made a move.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Oh, Harold?



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          You see what I'm getting at? If 
          Santiago didn't have anything on 
          you, then why did you give him a 
          Code Red?

                      DAWSON
          Because he broke the chain of command, 
          sir.

                      KAFFEE
          He what?

                      DAWSON
          He went outside his unit, sir. If he 
          had a problem, he should've spoken 
          to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then 
          Company Commander, then --

                      KAFFEE
          Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you 
          assault Santiago with the intent of 
          killing him?

                      DAWSON
          No sir.

                      KAFFEE
          What was your intent?

                      DAWSON
          To train him, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Train him to do what?

                      DAWSON
          Train him to think of his unit before 
          himself. To respect the code.

                      SAM
          What's the code?

                      DAWSON
          Unit Corps God Country.

                      SAM
          I beg your pardon?

                      DAWSON
          Unit Corps God Country, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          The Goverrment of the United States 
          wants to charge you two with murder. 
          You want me to go to the prosecutor 
          with unit, corps, god, country?



                      DAWSON
          That's our code, sir.




                      KAFFEE
          We'll be back. You guys need anything? 
          Books paper, cigarettes, a ham 
          sandwich?

                      DAWSON
          Sir. No thank you. Sir.



                      KAFFEE
          Harold, I think there's a concept 
          you better start warming up to.

                      DAWSON
          Sir?

                      KAFFEE
          I'm the only friend you've got.

          pointed, and said "Pa". She did. She 
          said "Pa".

                      KAFFEE
          She was pointing at a doorknob.

                      SAM
          That's right. Pointing, as if to

          is dead and that's a tragedy. But 
          he's dead because he had no code. 
          He's dead because he had no honor.

                      KAFFEE
          Santiago was gonna reveal the person's 
          name in exchange for a transfer. An 
          I getting this right?

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          If you feel there are any details 
          that I'm missing, you should free to 
          speak up.





                      JESSEP
          Thank you.

                      KAFFEE
          Now it was at this point that you 
          called Captain Markinson and Lt. 
          Kendrick into your office?

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          And what happened then?

                      JESSEP
          We agreed that for his own safety, 
          Santiago should be transferred off 
          the base.






                      KAFFEE
          Santiago was set to be transferred?

                      JESSEP
          On the first available flight to the 
          states. Six the next morning. Three 
          hours too late as it turned out.



                      KAFFEE
          Yeah.






                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Alright, that's all I have. Thanks 
          very much for your time.

                      KENDRICK
          The corporal's got the jeep outside, 
          he'll take you back to the airstrip.

                      KAFFEE
               (standing)
          Thank you.

                      JO
          Wait a minute, I've got some 
          questions.

                      KAFFEE
          No you don't.

                      JO
          Yes I do.

                      KAFFEE
          No you don't.

                      JO
          Colonel, on the morning that Santiago 
          died, did you meet with Doctor Stone 
          between three and five?

                      KAFFEE
          Jo --

                      JESSEP
          Of course I met with the doctor. One 
          of my men was dead.

                      KAFFEE
               (to JO)
          See? The man was dead. Let's go.

                      JO
               (to JESSEP)
          I was wondering if you've ever heard 
          the term Code Red.

                      KAFFEE
          Jo --

                      JESSEP
          I've heard the term, yes.

                      JO
          Colonel, this past February, you 
          received a cautionary memo from the 
          Naval Investigative Service, warning 
          that the practice of enlisted men 
          disciplining their own wasn't to be 
          condoned by officers.

                      JESSEP
          I submit to you that whoever wrote 
          that memo has never served on the 
          working end of a Soviet-made Cuban 
          Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the 
          directive having come from the NIS, 
          I gave it its due attention. What's 
          your point, Jo?

                      KAFFEE
          She has no point. She often has no 
          point. It's part of her charm. We're 
          outta here. Thank you.

                      JO
          My point is that I think code reds 
          still go on down here. Do Code Reds 
          still happen on this base, colonel?

                      KAFFEE
          Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer 
          that.

                      JO
          Yes he does.

                      KAFFEE
          No, he really doesn't.

                      JO
          Yeah, he really does. Colonel?

                      JESSEP
          You know it just hit me. She outranks 
          you, Danny.

                      KAFFEE
          Yes sir.

                      JESSEP
          I want to tell you something Danny 
          and listen up 'cause I mean this: 
          You're the luckiest man in the world. 
          There is, believe me gentlemen, 
          nothing sexier on earth than a woman 
          you have to salute in the morning. 
          Promote 'em all I say.




                      JO
          Colonel, the practice of code Reds 
          is still condoned by officers on 
          this base, isn't it?

                      JESSEP
          You see my problem is, of course, 
          that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have 
          to keep taking cold showers 'til 
          they elect some gal President.

                      JO
          I need an answer to my question, 
          sir.

                      JESSEP
          Take caution in your tone, Commander.  
          I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' 
          heat's making me absolutely crazy. 
          You want to know about code reds?  
          On the record I tell you that I 
          discourage the practice in accordance 
          with the NIS directive. Off the record 
          I tell you that it's an invaluable 
          part of close infantry training, and 
          if it happens to go on without my 
          knowledge, so be it. I run my base 
          how I run my base. You want to 
          investigate me, roll the dice and 
          take your chances. I eat breakfast 
          80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who 
          are trained to kill me. So don't for 
          one second think you're gonna come 
          down here, flash a badge, and make 
          me nervous.



                      KAFFEE
          Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a 
          copy of Santiago's transfer order.

                      JESSEP
          What's that?

                      KAFFEE
          Santiago's transfer order. You guys 
          have paper work on that kind of thing, 
          I just need it for the file.

                      JESSEP
          For the file.

                      KAFFEE
          Yeah.

                      JESSEP
               (pause)
          Of course you can have a copy of the 
          transfer order. For the file. I'm 
          here to help anyway I can.

                      KAFFEE
          Thank you.

                      JESSEP
          You believe that, don't you? Danny? 
          That I'm here to help anyway I can?

                      KAFFEE
          Of course.

                      JESSEP
          The corporal'll run you by Ordinance 
          on your way out to the airstrip. You 
          can have all the transfer orders you 
          want.

                      KAFFEE
               (to JO and SAM)
          Let's go.



                      JESSEP
          But you have to ask me nicely.



                      KAFFEE
          I beg your pardon?

                      JESSEP
          You have to ask me nicely. You see, 
          Danny, I can deal with the bullets 
          and the bombs and the blood. I can 
          deal with the heat and the stress 
          and the fear. I don't want money and 
          I don't want medals. What I want is 
          for you to stand there in that faggoty 
          white uniform, and with your Harvard 
          mouth, extend me some fuckin' 
          courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely.





                      KAFFEE
          Colonel Jessep... if it's not too 
          much trouble, I'd like a copy of the 
          transfer order. Sir.



                      JESSEP
          No problem.






                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          I hate casualties, Matthew. There 
          are casualties even in victory. A 
          marine smothers a grenade and saves 
          his platoon, that marine's a hero. 
          The foundation of the unit, the fabric 
          of this base, the spirit of the Corps, 
          they are things worth fighting for.



                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          Dawson and Downey, they don't know 
          it, but they're smothering a grenade.

          I've really missed you, Jo. I was

          When?

                      JO
          This afternoon. Sometime after we 
          left.

                      KAFFEE
          I'll talk to him in the morning.

                      JO
          I already tried, I can't find him.

                      KAFFEE
          You tried? Joanne, you're coming 
          dangerously close to the textbook 
          definition of interfering with a 
          government investigation.



                      JO
          I'm Louden Downey's attorney.



                      JO
               (continuing)
          Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like 
          she's known me for years. I suggested 
          that she might feel more comfortable 
          if I were directly involved with the 
          case. She had Louden sign the papers 
          about an hour ago.




                      KAFFEE
          I suppose it's way too much to hope 
          that you're just making this up to 
          bother me.

                      JO
          Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a 
          motion for separation, you're still 
          lead counsel.

          I think Kendrick ordered the Code

          So do you.

          Did Kendrick order the code red?

          Sir?

                      KAFFEE
          Don't say sir like I just asked you 
          if you cleaned the latrine. You heard 
          what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order 
          you guys to give Santiago a code 
          red?

                      DAWSON
          Yes sir.

          Fuck you, Harold.



                      JO
          Alright. Let's sort this out. There 
          was a platoon meeting on August 6th 
          at four in the afternoon. And Lt. 
          Kendrick, he gave strict instructions 
          that nothing was to happen to 
          Santiago. Now is that true? I want 
          you to speak freely.

                      DAWSON
          Ma'am, that's correct. But then he 
          dismissed the platoon and we all 
          went to our rooms.

                      JO
          And what happened then?

                      DAWSON
          Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

                      KAFFEE
          When?

                      DAWSON
          About five minutes after the meeting 
          broke, sir. About 16:20.

                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          And what happened then?

                      DAWSON
          Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give 
          Santiago a Code Red.

                      KAFFEE
          They were given an order.





                      JO
          How long have you known about the 
          order?

                      ROSS
          I didn't --
               (to KAFFEE)
          Who is this?

                      KAFFEE
          This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's 
          lawyer. She's very pleased to meet 
          you.

                      ROSS
          What exactly are you accusing me of, 
          commander?

                      JO
          I'm accusing you of --







                      KAFFEE
          Jack didn't know about the order. 
          Because if he did and he hadn't told 
          us, Jack knows he'd be violating 
          about 14 articles of the code of 
          ethics. As it is, he's got enough to 
          worry about. God forbid our clients 
          decide to plead not guilty and testify 
          for the record that they were given 
          an order.

                      ROSS
          Kendrick specifically told the men 
          not to touch Santiago.

                      KAFFEE
          That's right. And then he went into 
          Dawson and Downey's room and 
          specifically told them to give him a 
          code red.

                      ROSS
          That's not what Kendrick said.

                      KAFFEE
          Kendrick's lying.

          You have proof?

          I have the defendants.

          We'll never know.

          You don't think I can subpoena 
          Markinson.

                      ROSS
          You can try, but you won't find him.  
          You know what Markinson did for the 
          first 17 of his 21 years in the corps? 
          Counter Intelligence. Markinson's 
          gone. There is no Markinson.

          I'll knock it all down to assault.

          No you're not.

          Why not?

                      ROSS
          'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows 
          it. And he knows that if we go to 
          court, I'll have to go all the way, 
          they'll be charged with the whole 
          truckload. Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct 
          Unbecoming, and even though he's got 
          me by the balls out here, Dan knows 
          that in a courtroom, he loses this 
          case. Danny's an awfully talented 
          lawyer, and he's not about to send 
          his clients go to jail for life when 
          he knows they could be home in six 
          months.

          just said, you're going home in six 
          months.

                      DAWSON
          I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Do what?

                      DAWSON
          Make a deal, sir.

          What are you talking about?

                      DAWSON
          We did nothing wrong, sir. We did 
          our job. If that has consequences, 
          then I accept them. But'I won't say 
          I'm guilty, sir.

          Did she put you up to this?

          No.

                      DAWSON
          We have a code, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Well zippity-doo-dah. You and your 
          code plead not guilty and you'll be 
          in jail for the rest of your life. 
          Do what I'm telling you and you'll 
          be home in six months.

          Do it, Harold. Six months. It's

          Speak!

          What do we do then, sir?

                      KAFFEE
          When?

                      DAWSON
          After six months. We'd be dishonorably 
          discharged, right sir?

                      KAFFEE
          Yes.

                      DAWSON
          What do we do then, sir? We joined 
          the corps 'cause we wanted to live 
          our lives by a certain code. And we 
          found it in the corps. And now you're 
          asking us to sign a piece of paper 
          that says we have no honor. You're 
          asking us to say we're not marines. 
          If a judge and jury decide that what 
          we did was wrong, I'll accept whatever 
          punishment they give. But I believe 
          I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my 
          job. And I won't dishonor myself, my 
          unit, or the Corps, so that I can qo 
          home in six months.

          I'm not gonna feel responsible for 
          this, Harold. I did everything I 
          could. You're going to Levenworth

          off a cliff, that's his business.

          I want to get him a new lawyer. How 
          do I do it?

                      SAM
          You just make a motion tomorrow 
          morning at the arraignment. The 
          judge'll ask you if you want to enter 
          a plea. You tell him you want new 
          counsel assigned.

          Yeah. One thing, though. When you 
          ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, 
          be sure and ask nicely.

                      KAFFEE
          What do you want from me?

                      JO
          I want you to let 'em be judged! I 
          want you to stand up and make an 
          argument!

                      SAM
          An argument that didn't work for 
          Calley at My Lai, an argument that 
          didn't work for the Nazis at 
          Nuremberg.

                      KAFFEE
          For Christ sake, Sam, do you really 
          think that's the same as two teenage 
          marines executing a routine order 
          that they never believed would result 
          in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis.



                      JO
          Don't look now, Danny, but you're 
          making an argument.

                      KAFFEE
               (pause)
          Yeah.
               (beat)
          Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new 
          attorney.

                      JO
          Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? 
          Were daddy's expectations really 
          that high?

                      KAFFEE
          Please, spare me the psycho-babble 
          father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll 
          have their day in court, but they'll 
          have it with another lawyer.

                      JO
          Another lawyer won't be good enough. 
          They need you. You know how to win.
               (beat)
          You know they have a case. And you 
          know how to win. You walk away from 
          this now, and you have sealed their 
          fate.

                      KAFFEE
          Their fate was sealed the moment 
          Santiago died.

                      JO
          Do you believe they have a defense?

                      KAFFEE
          You and Dawson both live in the same 
          dreamland. It doesn't matter what I 
          believe, it only matters what I can 
          prove. So please don't tell me what 
          I know and don't know. I know the 
          law.




                      JO
          You know nothing about the law. You're 
          a used car salesman, Daniel. You're 
          an ambulance chaser with a rank. 
          You're nothing.
               (beat)
          Live with that.

          boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes 
          of black pens. Sam get a couple of 
          desk lamps. I need you to start on a 
          preliminary medical profile and Jo, 
          we need all the fitness reports on

          She said if Markinson doesn't want

          We're a little weak on motive. They 
          had one.

          I don't know what made Santiago die, 
          I don't want to know. I just want to 
          be able to show it could've been 
          something other than poison. Jo,

          know what killed Santiago, then he 
          meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock 
          he says it was poison? The doctor's

                      ROSS
               (continuing)
          The facts of the case are this: At 
          midnight on August 6th, the defendants 
          went into the barracks room of their 
          platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
          They woke him up, tied his arms and 
          legs with rope, and forced a rag 
          into his throat. A few minutes later, 
          a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
          body called lactic acidosis caused 
          his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
          drowned in his own blood and was 
          pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
          midnight. These are the facts of the 
          case. And they are undisputed. That's 
          right. The story I just told you is 
          the exact same story you're going to 
          hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's 
          the exact same story you're going to 
          hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, 
          the Government will also demonstrate 
          that the defendants soaked the rag 
          with poison, and entered Santiago's 
          room with motive and intent to kill.
               (beat)
          Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to 
          pull off a little magic act, he's 
          gonna try a little misdirection. 
          He's going to astonish you with 
          stories of rituals and dazzle you 
          with official sounding terms like 
          Code Red. He might even cut into a 
          few officers for you. He'll have no 
          evidence, mind you, none. But it's 
          gonna be entertaining. When we get 
          to the end, all the magic in the 
          world will not have been able to 
          divert your attention from the fact 
          that Willy Santiago is dead, and 
          Dawson and Downey killed him. These 
          are the facts of the case.
               (beat)
          And they are undisputed.



                      RANDOLPH
          Lt. Kaffee?




                      KAFFEE
          There was no poison on the rag and 
          there was no intent to kill and any 
          attempt to prove otherwise is futile 
          because it just ain't true.
               (beat)
          When Dawson and Downey went into 
          Santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
          because of vengeance or hatred, it 
          wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
          because they were looking for kicks 
          on a Friday night. It's because it 
          was what they were ordered to do.
               (beat)
          Let me say that again: It's because 
          it was what they were ordered to do. 
          Now, out in the real world, that 
          means nothing. And here at the 
          Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't 
          mean a whole lot more. But if you're 
          a marine assigned to Rifle Security 
          Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
          Cuba, and you're given an order, you 
          follow it or you pack your bags.
               (beat)
          Make no mistake about it, Harold 
          Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting 
          before you in judgement today because 
          they did their job.

          shooting?

          Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what 
          you mean when you say there wasn't 
          enough evidence to support such a 
          charge. You had Willy Santiago's 
          letter.

                      MCGUIRE
          Santiago was the only witness, but I 
          never had a chance to interview him. 
          So I don't know what he saw.

                      ROSS
          And now we won't ever know, will we, 
          Mr. McGuire?

          Lt. Kendrick told us that we had an

          on a member of our platoon.

          Company Windward to testify.

                      ROSS
          In light of the defense that Lt.

          explicit instructions of the platoon

          testimony.

          that all 23 witnesses will testify 
          substantially as Corporal Hammaker

                      ROSS
          Dr. Stone, what's lactic acidosis?

                      STONE
          If the muscles and other cells of 
          the body burn sugar instead of oxygen, 
          lactic acid is produced. That lactic 
          acid is what caused Santiago's lungs 
          to bleed.

                      ROSS
          How long does it take for the muscles 
          and other cells to begin burning 
          oxygen instead of sugar?

          Twenty to thirty minutes.

                      ROSS
          And what caused Santiago's muscles 
          and other cells to start burning 
          sugar?

                      STONE
          An ingested poison of some kind.

                      KAFFEE
          Your Honor, we object at this point. 
          The witness is speculating.

                      ROSS
          Commander Stone is an expert medical 
          witness, in this courtroom his opinion 
          isn't considered speculation.

                      KAFFEE
          Commander Stone is an internist, not 
          a criminologist, and the medical 
          facts here are ultimately 
          inconclusive.

                      RANDOLPH
          A point which I'm confident you'll 
          illustrate to the jury under cross- 
          examination, so I'm sure you won't 
          mind if his opinion is admitted now.

                      KAFFEE
          Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn.



                      ROSS
          Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die 
          of poisoning?

                      STONE
          Absolutely.

                      ROSS
          Are you aware that the lab report 
          and the coroners report showed no 
          traces of poison?

                      STONE
          Yes I am.

                      ROSS
          Then how do you justify --

                      STONE
          There are literally dozens of toxins 
          which are virtually undetectable, 
          both in the human body and on a 
          fabric. The nature of the acidosis 
          is the compelling factor in this 
          issue.

                      ROSS
          Thank you, sir.



                      KAFFEE
          Commander, you testified that it 
          takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes 
          before it becomes lethal.

                      STONE
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          Let me ask you, is it possible for a 
          person to have an affliction, some 
          sort of condition, which might, in 
          the case of this person, actually 
          speed up the process of acidosis 
          dramatically?



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Commander, is it possible?

                      STONE
          Certainly.

                      KAFFEE
          What might some of those conditions 
          be?

                      STONE
               (beat)
          If a person had a coronary disorder... 
          or a cerebral disorder, the process 
          would be more rapid.

                      KAFFEE
          Commander, if I had a coronary 
          condition, and a perfectly clean rag 
          was placed in my mouth, and the rag 
          was accidentally pushed too far down, 
          is it possible that my cells would 
          continue burning sugar after the rag 
          was taken out?

                      STONE
          It would have to be a very serious 
          condition.

                      KAFFEE
          Is it possible to have a serious 
          coronary condition, where the initial 
          warning signals were so mild as to 
          escape a physician during a routine 
          medical exam?

                      STONE
          Possibly. There would still be 
          symptoms though.

                      KAFFEE
          What kind of symptoms?

                      STONE
          There are hundreds of symptoms of a --

                      KAFFEE
          Chest pains?

          Yes.

          Shortness of breath?

          Yes.

          Fatigue?

          This in an order for Private Santiago

          you read your hand written remarks

          of breath, and fatigue. Restricted

          miles for one week."

                      KAFFEE
          Commander, isn't it possible that 
          Santiago had a serious coronary 
          condition, and it was that condition, 
          and not some mysterious poison, that 
          caused the accelerated chemical 
          reaction?

                      STONE
          No. I personally give the men a 
          physical examination every three 
          months. And every three months Private 
          Santiago got a clean bill of health.

                      KAFFEE
          And that's why it had to be, poison, 
          right, Commander? 'Cause Lord knows, 
          if you put a man with a serious 
          coronary condition back on duty with 
          a clean bill of health, and that man 
          died from a heart related incident, 
          you'd have a lot to answer for,

          It's alright. We've been working 20 
          hour days for three and a half weeks 
          straight. Take the night off. Go see 
          your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do

          'Cause they stand on a wall.

                      JO
          I'm sorry to bother you, I should've 
          called first.

                      KAFFEE
          No, I was just watching a baseball 
          game.

                      JO
          I was wondering if -- how you'd feel 
          about my taking you to dinner tonight.

                      KAFFEE
          Jo, are you asking me out on a date?

                      JO
          No.

                      KAFFEE
          It sounded like you were asking me 
          out on a date.

                      JO
          I wasn't.

                      KAFFEE
          I've been asked out on dates before, 
          and that's what it sounded like.

                      JO
          Do you like seafood? I know a good 
          seafood place.

          My third case was a Drunk and 
          Disorderly. The trial lasted nine 
          weeks. I rounded up 31 people who 
          were in the bar that night.

                      KAFFEE
          Nine weeks on a D and D? What was 
          the prosecutor offering?

                      JO
          15 days.

          Because I want you to think I'm good 
          lawyer.

          I do.

          No you don't.

          I think you're an exceptional lawyer. 
          I watch the jurors, they respond to 
          you, they like you. I see you 
          convincing them. I think Dawson and 
          Downey are gonna end up owing their

          that it would actually matter to 
          this jury that the guys were given

          We'll keep doing what we're doing,

          testimony of two people accused of 
          murder.

          We'll find Markinson.

                      KAFFEE
          Corporal Howard, name some reasons 
          why a marine would get a code red?

                      HOWARD
          Being late for platoon or company 
          meetings, keeping his barracks in 
          disorder, falling back on a run...

                      KAFFEE
          Have you ever received a code red?

                      HOWARD
          Yes sir. We were doing seven man 
          assault drills, and my weapon slipped. 
          It's just cause it was over a hundred 
          degrees and my palms were sweaty and 
          I'd forgot to use the resin like we 
          were taught.

                      KAFFEE
          And what happened?

                      HOWARD
          That night the guys in my squad threw 
          a blanket over me and took turns 
          punching me in the arm for five 
          minutes. Then they poured glue on my 
          hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I 
          ain't never dropped my weapon since.

                      KAFFEE
          Was Private Santiago ever late for 
          platoon meetings?

                      HOWARD
          Yes sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Was his barracks ever in disorder?

                      HOWARD
          Yes sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Did he ever fall back on a run?

                      HOWARD
          All the time, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Did he ever, prior to the night of 
          August 6th, receive a code red?

                      HOWARD
          No sir.

                      KAFFEE
               (beat)
          Never?

                      HOWARD
          No, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          You got a code red 'cause your palms 
          were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, 
          this burden to his unit, ever get 
          one?

                      HOWARD
          Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Dawson wouldn't allow it.

                      HOWARD
          The guys talked tough about Santiago, 
          but they wouldn't go near him. They 
          were too afraid of Dawson, sir.

                      ROSS
          Object. The witness is characterizing.

                      KAFFEE
          I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever 
          want to give Santiago a code red?

                      HOWARD
          Yes sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Why didn't you?

                      HOWARD
          'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask 
          you some questions now.




                      ROSS
          Corporal Howard, I hold here The 
          Marine Guide and General Information 
          Handbook for New Recruits. Are you 
          familiar with this book?

                      HOWARD
          Yes sir.

                      ROSS
          Have you read it?

                      HOWARD
          Yes sir.

                      ROSS
          Good.
               (hands him the book)
          Would you turn to the chapter that 
          deals with code reds, please.

                      HOWARD
          Sir?

                      ROSS
          Just flip to the page in that book 
          that discusses code reds.

                      HOWARD
          Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we 
          use -- it's just used down at GITMO, 
          sir. I don't know if it actually --



                      ROSS
          We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps 
          Guide for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE 
          Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll 
          find the term code red and its 
          definition in this book, am I correct?

                      HOWARD
          No sir.

                      ROSS
          No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. 
          Is their no book, no manual or 
          pamphlet, no set of orders or 
          regulations that let me know that, 
          as a marine, one of my duties is to 
          perform code reds?

                      HOWARD
               (pause)
          No sir. No books, sir.

                      ROSS
          No further questions.




                      KAFFEE
          Corporal, would you turn to the page 
          in this book that says where the 
          enlisted men's mess hall is?

                      HOWARD
          Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, 
          sir.

                      KAFFEE
          I don't understand, how did you know 
          where the enlisted men's mess hall 
          was if it's not in this book?

                      HOWARD
          I guess I just followed the crowd at 
          chow time, sir.

                      KAFFEE
          No more questions.



                      RANDOLPH
          Corporal Howard, you can step down.

          Thank you, sir.

          I know.

          We've got the transfer order. It's 
          got your signature.

                      MARKINSON
          I know. I signed it the morning you 
          arrived in Cuba. Six days after 
          Santiago died.



                      KAFFEE
          I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind 
          of immunity with the prosecutor. In 
          about four days, you're gonna appear 
          as a witness for the defense, and 
          you're gonna tell the court exactly 
          what you told me. Right now I'm gonna 
          check you into a motel, and we're 
          gonna start from the beginning.

          was the first flight Santiago could've 
          left on, Markinson says there was a 
          plane that left seven hours earlier.

          Sam, when a plane takes off from a 
          base, there's gotta be some kind of 
          record kept, right?

          know what the log book's gonna say.

          The transfer order that Parkinson 
          signed is phoney. And Jessep's 
          statement that the six a.m. flight 
          was the first available is a lie, 
          we're checking the tower chief's

          you'll be subject to Court-Martial

          wanna beat the shit outta something.

          Don't you dare lump me in with Jessep

          we wear the same uniform. I'm your

          the possible consequences involved 
          in accusing a marine officer of a 
          felony without proper evidence.

                      KAFFEE
          Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was 
          Private Santiago a good marine?

                      KENDRICK
          I'd say he was about average.

                      KAFFEE
          Lieutenant, you signed three fitness 
          reports on Santiago. On all three 
          reports you indicated a rating of 
          Below Average.

                      KENDRICK
          Yes. Private Santiago was Below 
          Average I didn't see the need in 
          trampling on a man's grave.

                      KAFFEE
          We appreciate that, but you're under 
          oath now, and I think unpleasant as 
          it may be, we'd all just as soon 
          hear the truth.

                      KENDRICK
          I'm aware of my oath.



                      KAFFEE
          Lieutenant, these are the last three 
          fitness reports you signed for Lance 
          Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey 
          received three straight marks of 
          Exceptional. Dawson received two 
          marks of Exceptional, but on this 
          most recent report, dated June 9th 
          of this year, he received a rating 
          of Below Average. It's this last 
          report that I'd like to discuss for 
          a moment.

                      KENDRICK
          That's fine.

                      KAFFEE
          Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after 
          Infantry Training School was perfect. 
          Records indicate that over half that 
          class has since been promoted to 
          full corporal, while Dawson has 
          remained a lance corporal. Was 
          Dawson's promotion held up because 
          of this last fitness report.

                      KENDRICK
          I'm sure it was.

                      KAFFEE
          Do you recall why Dawson was given 
          such a poor grade on this report?

                      KENDRICK
          I'm sure I don't. I have many men in 
          my charge, Lieutenant, I write many 
          fitness reports.

                      KAFFEE
          Do you recall an incident involving 
          a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found 
          stealing liquor from the Officer's 
          Club?

                      KENDRICK
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          Did you report private Barnes to the 
          proper authorities?

                      KENDRICK
          I have two books at my bedside, 
          Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct 
          and the King James Bible. The only 
          proper authorities I'm aware of are 
          my Commanding Officer, Colonel Nathan 
          R. Jessep and the Lord our God.

                      KAFFEE
          Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can 
          have the record reflect your lack of 
          acknowledgment of this court as a 
          proper authority.

                      ROSS
          Objection. Argumentative.

               (to KAFFEE)
          Watch yourself, counselor.

                      KAFFEE
          Did you report Private Barnes to 
          your superiors?

                      KENDRICK
          I remember thinking very highly of 
          Private Barnes, and not wanting to 
          see his record tarnished by a formal 
          charge.

                      KAFFEE
          You preferred it to be handled within 
          the unit.

                      KENDRICK
          I most certainly did.

                      KAFFEE
          Lieutenant, do you know what a Code 
          Red is?

                      KENDRICK
          Yes I do.

                      KAFFEE
          Have you ever ordered a code red?

                      KENDRICK
          No, I have not.

                      KAFFEE
          Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and 
          two other men to make sure that 
          Private Barnes receive no food or 
          drink except water for a period of 
          seven days?

                      KENDRICK
          That's a distortion of the truth. 
          Private Barnes was placed on barracks 
          restriction. He was given water and 
          vitamin supplements, and I assure 
          you that at no time was his health 
          in danger.

                      KAFFEE
          I'm sure it was lovely for Private 
          Barnes, but you did order the barracks 
          restriction, didn't you? And you did 
          order the denial of food.

                      KENDRICK
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          Wouldn't this form of discipline be 
          considered a code red?

                      KENDRICK
               (beat)
          Not necessarily.

                      KAFFEE
          If I called the other 8000 men at 
          Guantanamo Bay to testify, would 
          they consider it a Code Red?

                      ROSS
          Please the court, the witness can't 
          possibly testify as to what 8000 
          other men would say. We object to 
          this entire line of questioning as 
          argumentative and irrelevant badgering 
          of the witness.

                      RANDOLPH
          The Government's objection is 
          sustained, Lt. Kaffee, and I would 
          remind you that you're now questioning 
          marine officer with an impeccable 
          service record.

                      ROSS
          Thank you judge.




                      KAFFEE
          Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating 
          of Below Average on this last fitness 
          report because you learned held been 
          sneaking food to Private Barnes?
               (to ROSS)
          Not so fast.
               (to KENDRICK)
          Lieutenant?

                      KENDRICK
          Corporal Dawson was found to be Below 
          Average because he committed a crime.

                      KAFFEE
          What crime did he commit?
               (beat)
          Lieutenant Kendrick?
               (beat)
          Dawson brought a hungry guy some 
          food. What crime did he commit?

                      KENDRICK
          He disobeyed an order.

                      KAFFEE
          And because he did, because he 
          exercised his own set of values, 
          because he made a decision about the 
          welfare of a marine that was in 
          conflict with an order of yours, he 
          was punished, is that right?

                      KENDRICK
          Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.

                      KAFFEE
          Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? 
          After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't 
          being asked to secure a hill... or 
          advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely 
          a marine of Dawson's intelligence 
          can be trusted to determine on his 
          own, which are the really important 
          orders, and which orders might, say, 
          be morally questionable.
               (beat)
          Lt. Kendrick?
               (beat)
          Can he? Can Corporal Dawson determine 
          on his own which orders he's gonna 
          follow?
               (pause)

                      KENDRICK
          No, he can not.

                      KAFFEE
          A lesson he learned after the Curtis 
          Barnes incident, am I right?

                      KENDRICK
          I would think so.

                      KAFFEE
          You know so, don't you, Lieutenant.

          Director of Operations for the 
          National Security Council. You don't 
          get to that position without knowing 
          how to side-step a few land mines.
               (beat)
          And putting me on the stand isn't 
          gonna make him step on one.






                      KAFFEE
          You're taking the stand. Thursday.





                                                     CUT TO:






                      KAFFEE
          There's gotta be someone who can 
          testify to the flight. A ground crew 
          member. Someone.

                      SAM
          Do you have any idea how many planes 
          take off and land every day? A kid 
          from the ground crew isn't gonna 
          remember a flight that landed four 
          weeks ago.

                      KAFFEE
          Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson 
          on the stand and we'll deal with 
          Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago 
          and he'll testify to the forged 
          transfer order. That'll be enough. 
          That and Downey's testimony really 
          oughta be enough.

                                                     CUT TO:





                      JO
          Private Downey, why did you go into 
          Santiago's room on the night of the 
          6th?

                      DOWNEY
          To give Private Santiago a Code Red, 
          ma'am.

                      JO
          And why did you give him a Code Red?

                      DOWNEY
          I was ordered to give him a Code Red 
          by the Executive officer for Rifle 
          Security Company Windward, Lieutenent 
          Jonathan James Kendrick.



                      JO
          You're gonna do fine.



                      DOWNEY
          You think they'll let us go back to 
          our platoon soon, ma'am?

                      JO
               (pause)
          Absolutely.

                                                     CUT TO:





                      JO
          You remember the order of the 
          questions?

                      KAFFEE
          Yes.

                      JO
          Are you sure?

                      KAFFEE
          Yes.

                      JO
          And you'll use small words?

                      KAFFEE
          Yes.

                      JO
          He gets rattled when he doesn't 
          understand something.

                      KAFFEE
          Jo --

                      JO
          I'm just saying go slow.

                      KAFFEE
          I'm gonna go slow.

                      JO
          Okay.

                      KAFFEE
          Alright.

                      JO
          And get him off as fast as you can.

                      KAFFEE
          Joanne!

                      JO
          What?

                      KAFFEE
          He's gonna be fine.

                                                     CUT TO:





                      MARKINSON (V.O.)
          I was William's company commander.  
          I knew your son vaguely, which is to 
          say I knew his name...






                      MARKINSON (V.O.)
          In a matter of time, the trial of 
          the two man charged with your son's 
          death will be concluded, and seven 
          men and two women whom you've never 
          met will try to offer you an 
          explanation as to why William is 
          dead. For my part, I've done as much 
          as I can to bring the truth to light.




                      MARKINSON (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          And the truth is this: your son is 
          dead for only one reason. I wasn't 
          strong enough to stop it.




                      MARKINSON (V.O.)
          Always, Captain Matthew Andrew 
          Markinson.

                      KAFFEE
          Private, I want you to tell us one 
          last time: Why did you go into Private 
          Santiago's room on the night of August 
          6th?

                      DOWNEY
          A code red was ordered by my platoon 
          commander, Lt. Jonathan James 
          Kendrick.

                      KAFFEE
          Thank you.
               (to ROSS)
          Your witness.

                      ROSS
          Private, for the week of 2 August, 
          the switch log has you down at Post 
          39, is that correct?

                      DOWNEY
          I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that 
          log pretty good.

                      ROSS
          How far is it from Post 39 to the 
          Windward barracks?

                      DOWNEY
          It's a ways, sir, it's a hike.

                      ROSS
          About how far by jeep?

                      DOWNEY
          About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.

                      ROSS
          Have you ever had to walk it?

                      DOWNEY
          Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The 
          Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what 
          we call the fella who drops us at 
          our posts and picks us up... also, 
          'cause he can get girls in New York 
          City -- the Pick-up Private got a 
          flat...








                      DOWNEY
               (continuing)
          ...Right at 39. He pulled up and 
          blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. 
          The two of us had to double-time it 
          back to the barracks.

                      ROSS
          And if it's ten or fifteen minutes 
          by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a 
          good hour by foot, am I right?

                      DOWNEY
          Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, 
          sir.

                      ROSS
          Not bad. Now you say your assault on 
          Private Santiago was the result of 
          an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in 
          your barracks room at 16:20.




                      DOWNEY
          Yes sir.



                      ROSS
          But you just said that you didn't 
          make it back to Windward Barracks 
          until 16:45.




                      DOWNEY
          Sir?

                      ROSS
          If you didn't make it back to your 
          barracks until 16:45, then how could 
          you be in your room at 16:20?

                      DOWNEY
               (pause)
          You see sir, there was a flat tire.

                      ROSS
          Private, did you ever actually hear 
          Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?




                      DOWNEY
               (pause)
          No, sir.



                      JO
          Please the court, I'd like to request 
          a recess in order to confer with my 
          client.

                      ROSS
          Why did you go into Santiago's room?

                      JO
          The witness has rights.

                      ROSS
          The witness has been read his rights, 
          commander.

                      DOWNEY
               (confused)
          Hal?

                      RANDOLPH
          The question will be repeated.

                      ROSS
          Why did you go into Santiago's room?

                      JO
          Your honor --

                      DOWNEY
          Hal?

                      ROSS
          Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do 
          it?



                      ROSS
               (continuing)
          He did, didn't he? Dawson told you 
          to give Santiago a code red.



                      DOWNEY
          Hal?

                      ROSS
          Don't look at him.

                      DOWNEY
          Hal?

                      DAWSON
          Private. Answer the Lieutenant's 
          question.






                      DOWNEY
          Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order 
          by my squad leader, Lance Corporal 
          Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine 
          Corps. And I followed it.








                      JO
          Where do you think he is?




                      JO
               (continuing)
          As far as Downey was concerned, it 
          was an order from Kendrick. It didn't 
          matter that he didn't hear it first 
          hand. He doesn't distinguish between 
          the two.




                      JO
               (continuing)
          Danny. I'm sorry.



                      KAFFEE
          Don't worry about it.

                      JO
          Sam and I were just talking about 
          how all we really have to do is call 
          some witnesses who'll talk about 
          implied orders... or maybe we put 
          Downey back on the stand before we 
          get to Dawson.

                      KAFFEE
          Maybe if we work at it we can get 
          Dawson charged with the Kennedy 
          assassination.



                      JO
          Are you drunk?

                      KAFFEE
               (a simple answer)
          Pretty much. Yeah.

                      JO
               (pause)
          I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a 
          long night's work ahead.

                      KAFFEE
          She's gonna make coffee. That's nice.
               (beat)
          He wasn't in his room.
               (Kaffee's amazed)
          He wasn't even there.
               (beat)
          That was an important piece of 
          information, don't you think?

                      JO
               (pause)
          Danny, it was just a setback. I'm 
          sorry. But we'll fix it and then 
          move on to Markinson.

                      KAFFEE
          Markinson's dead.






                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          You really gotta hand it to those 
          Federal Marshals, boy.
               (he almost has to 
               laugh)
          It's not like he hanged himself by 
          his shoelaces or slashed his wrists 
          with a concealed butter knife. This 
          guy got, into full dress uniform, 
          stood in the middle of that room, 
          drew a nickle plated pistol from his 
          holster, and fired a bullet into his 
          mouth.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Anyway, since we seem to be out of 
          witnesses, I thought I'd drink a 
          little.

                      JO
          I still think we can win.

                      KAFFEE
          Then maybe you should drink a little.

                      JO
          Look, we'll go to Randolph in the 
          morning and make a motion for a 
          continuance. 24 hours.

                      KAFFEE
               (beat)
          Why would we want to do that?

                      JO
          To subpoena Colonel Jessep.

                      KAFFEE
          What?

                      JO
          Listen for a second --

                      KAFFEE
          No.

                      JO
          Just hear me out --

                      KAFFEE
          No. I won't listen to you and I won't 
          hear you out. Your passion is 
          comforting, Jo. It's also useless. 
          Private Downey needed a trial lawyer 
          today.

                      JO
               (pause)
          You chicken-shit. You're gonna use 
          what happened today as an excuse to 
          give up.

                      KAFFEE
          It's over!

                      JO
          Why did you ask Jessep for the 
          transfer order?

                      KAFFEE
          What are you --

                      JO
          In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for 
          the transfer order?

                      KAFFEE
          What does it matter --

                      JO
          Why?!

                      KAFFEE
          I wanted the damn transfer order!

                      JO
          Bullshit! You could've gotten it by 
          picking up the phone and calling any 
          one of a dozen departments at the 
          Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer 
          order. You wanted to see Jessep's 
          reaction when you asked for the 
          transfer order. You had an instinct. 
          And it was confirmed by Markinson. 
          Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the 
          stand and end this thing!

                      KAFFEE
          What possible good could come from 
          putting Jessep on the stand?

                      JO
          He told Kendrick to order the Code 
          Red.

                      KAFFEE
          He did?! Why didn't you say so!? 
          That's qreat! And of course you have 
          proof of that.

                      JO
          I --

                      KAFFEE
          Ah, I keep forgetting: You were sick 
          the day they taught law at law school.

                      JO
          You put him on the stand and you get 
          it from him!

                      KAFFEE
          Yes. No problem. We get it from him.
               (to SAM)
          Colonel, isn't it true that you 
          ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

          Look, we're all a little --

                      KAFFEE
          I'm sorry, your time's run out. What 
          do we have for the losers, Judge? 
          Well, for our defendants it's a 
          lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. 
          And for defense counsel Kaffee? That's 
          right -- it's -- a court -- martial. 
          Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing 
          a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt.  
          Kaffee will have a long and prosperous 
          career teaching typewriter maintenance 
          at the Rocco Columbo School for Women.  
          Thank you for playing "Should We or 
          Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of 
          the Galacticly Stupid".

               (continuing)
          Sam. Stop cleaning up.

          You want a drink?

                      SAM
          Yeah.



                      KAFFEE
          Is your father proud of you?

                      SAM
          Don't do this to yourself.

                      KAFFEE
          I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores 
          the shit outta the neighbors and the 
          relatives. "Sam, made Law Review.  
          He's got a big case he's making -- 
          He's arguing making an argument."
               (pause)
          I think my father would've enjoyed 
          seeing me graduate from law school.
               (beat)
          I think he would've liked that... an 
          awful lot.

                      SAM
          Did I ever tell you that I wrote a 
          paper on your father in college?

                      KAFFEE
          Yeah?

                      SAM
          He was one of the best trial lawyers 
          ever.

                      KAFFEE
          Yes he was.

                      SAM
          And if I were Dawson and Downey and 
          I had a choice between you or your 
          father to represent me in this case, 
          I'd take you any day of the week and 
          twice on Sunday. You should have 
          seen yourself thunder away at 
          Kendrick.

                      KAFFEE
          Would you put Jessep on the stand?

                      SAM
          No.

                      KAFFEE
          You think my father would've?

                      SAM
          With the evidence we've got? Not in 
          a million years. But here's the thing --
          and there's really no way of getting 
          around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee 
          nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel 
          for the defense in the matter of 
          U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So 
          there's only one question. What would 
          you do?

          I say we hit him with the phoney 
          transfer order.

                      SAM
          What's the transfer order without a 
          witness?

                      KAFFEE
          We have a witness.

                      SAM
          A dead witness.

                      KAFFEE
          And in the hands of a lesser attorney, 
          that'd be a problem.

                      SAM
          Look at this. Last night he was 
          swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he 
          can leap tall buildings in a single 
          bound.

          Good.
               (beat)
          Jessep told Kendrick to order a code 
          red. Kendrick did, and our clients 
          followed the order. The cover-up 
          isn't our case. To win, Jessep has 
          to tell the jury that he ordered the 
          code red.

                      SAM
          And you think you can got him to 
          just say it?

                      KAFFEE
          I think he wants to say it. I think 
          he's pissed off that he's gotta hide 
          from us. I think he wants to say 
          that he made a command decision and 
          that's the end of it. He eats 
          breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 
          Cubans who are trained to kill him, 
          and no one's gonna tell him how to 
          run his base. Least of all the pushy 
          broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard 
          clown. I need to shake him and put 
          him on the defensive.



                      SAM
          That's it? That's the plan?

                      KAFFEE
          That's the plan.

                      SAM
          You're gonna trip Jessep and he's 
          gonna confess.

                      KAFFEE
          I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna 
          lead him right where he's dying to 
          go.

                      SAM
          And how are you gonna do that?

                      KAFFEE
          I have no idea. I need my bat.

          I put it in the closet.

          I was tripping over it.

          Don't ever put a bat in a closet.

                      JO
          He thinks better with his bat?





                      SAM (O.S.)
          I can understand that. I used to 
          have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I 
          could never do my home work without 
          him.

          Thank you, sir, would you have a 
          seat, please.



                      KAFFEE
          Colonel, when you learned of 
          Santiago's letter to the NIS, you 
          had a meeting with your two senior 
          officers, is that right?

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan 
          Kendrick, and the Company Commander, 
          Captain Matthew Markinson.

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          And at present, Captain Markinson is 
          dead, is that right?

                      ROSS
          Objection. I'd like to know just 
          what defense counsel is implying?

                      KAFFEE
          I'm implying simply that, at present, 
          Captain Markinson is not alive.

                      ROSS
          Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need 
          to appear in this courtroom to confirm 
          that information.

                      KAFFEE
          I just wasn't sure if the witness 
          was aware that two days ago, Captain 
          Markinson took his own life with a 
          .45 caliber pistol.








                      RANDOLPH (O.S.)
          The witness is aware, the Court is 
          aware, and now the jury is aware. We 
          thank you for bringing this to our 
          attention. Move on Lieutenant.





                      KAFFEE
          Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of 
          this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick 
          an order, is that right?

                      JESSEP
          I told Kendrick to tell his men that 
          Santiago wasn't to be touched.

                      KAFFEE
          And did you give an order to Captain 
          Markinson as well?

                      JESSEP
          I ordered Markinson to have Santiago 
          transferred off the base immediately.

                      KAFFEE
          Why?

                      JESSEP
          I felt that his life might be in 
          danger once word of the letter got 
          out.

                      KAFFEE
          Grave danger?

                      JESSEP
          Is there another kind?



                      KAFFEE
          We have the transfer order that you 
          and Markinson co-signed, ordering 
          that Santiago be lifted on a flight 
          leaving Guantanamo at six the next 
          morning. Was that the first flight 
          off the bass?

                      JESSEP
          The six a.m. flight was the first 
          flight off the base.






                      KAFFEE
          Colonel, you flew up to Washington 
          early this morning, is that right?

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          I notice you're wearing your Class A 
          appearance in dress uniform for court 
          today.

                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          As are you, Lieutenant.

                      KAFFEE
          Did you wear that uniform on the 
          plane?

                      ROSS
          Please the Court, is this dialogue 
          relevant to anything in particular?

                      KAFFEE
          The defense didn't have an opportunity 
          to depose this witness, your honor.  
          I'd ask the Court for a little 
          latitude.

                      RANDOLPH
          A very little latitude.

                      KAFFEE
          Colonel?

                      JESSEP
          I wore fatigues on the plane.

                      KAFFEE
          And you brought your dress uniform 
          with you.

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? 
          Change of underwear?

                      ROSS
          Your honor.

                      KAFFEE
               (to ROSS)
          Is the Colonel's underwear a matter 
          of national security?

                      RANDOLPH
          Gentlemen.
               (to KAFFEE)
          You better get somewhere fast with 
          this, Lieutenant.

                      KAFFEE
          Yes sir. Colonel?

                      JESSEP
          I brought a change of clothes and 
          some personal items.

                      KAFFEE
          Thank you.

          After Dawson and Downey's arrest on 
          the night of the sixth, Santiago's 
          barracks room was sealed off and its 
          contents inventoried.

          Pairs of camouflage pants, 6

          belts, 1 sweater --

                      ROSS
          Please the Court, is there a question 
          anywhere in our future?

                      RANDOLPH
          Lt. Kaffee, I have to --

                      KAFFEE
          I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't 
          packed.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          I'll tell you what, we'll get back 
          to that one in a minute.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          This is a record of all telephone 
          calls made from your base in the 
          past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed 
          to Washington, you made three calls.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          I've highlighted those calls in 
          yellow. Do you recognize those 
          numbers?

                      JESSEP
          I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in 
          Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him 
          know I'd be in town. The second call 
          was to set up a meeting with 
          Congressman Ramond of the House Armed 
          Services Committee, and the third 
          call was to my sister Elizabeth.

                      KAFFEE
          Why did you make that call, sir?

                      JESSEP
          I thought she might like to have 
          dinner tonight.

                      ROSS
          Judge --

                      RANDOLPH
          I'm gonna put a stop to this now.



                      KAFFEE
          Your honor, these are the telephone 
          records from GITMO for August 6th.  
          And these are 14 letters that Santiago 
          wrote in nine months requesting, in 
          fact begging, for a transfer.
               (to JESSEP)
          Upon hearing the news that he was 
          finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
          was so excited, that do you know how 
          many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
          Not one call to his parents saying 
          he was coming home. Not one call to 
          a friend saying can you pick me up 
          at the airport. He was asleep in his 
          bed at midnight, and according to 
          you he was getting on a plane in six 
          hours, yet everything he owned was 
          hanging neatly in his closet and 
          folded neatly in his footlocker. You 
          were leaving for one day and you 
          packed a bag and made three phone 
          calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
          rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
          a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
          Can you explain that? The fact is 
          there was no transfer order. Santiago 
          wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
          right, Colonel.

                      ROSS
          Object. Your Honor, it's obvious 
          that Lt. Kaffee's intention this 
          morning is to smear a high ranking 
          marine officer in the desperate hope 
          that the mere appearance of 
          impropriety will win him points with 
          the jury. It's my recommendation, 
          sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an 
          official reprimand from the bench, 
          and that the witness be excused with 
          the Court's deepest apologies.



                      RANDOLPH
               (pause)
          Overruled.

                      ROSS
          Your honor --

                      RANDOLPH
          The objection's noted.

                      KAFFEE
               (beat)
          Colonel?





                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Is this funny, sir?

                      JESSEP
          No. It's not. It's tragic.

                      KAFFEE
          Do you have an answer?

                      JESSEP
          Absolutely. My answer is I don't 
          have the first damn clue. Maybe he 
          was an early morning riser and he 
          liked to pack in the nq. And maybe 
          he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
          educated man, but I'm afraid I can't 
          speak intelligently about the travel 
          habits of William Santiago.  What I 
          do know is that he was set to leave 
          the base at 0600. Now are these really 
          the questions I was called here to 
          answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
          Please tell me you've got something 
          more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
          there's an ace up your sleeve. These 
          two marines are on trial for their 
          lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
          hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
          bill.
               (beat)
          Do you have any other questions for 
          me, counselor?






                      RANDOLPH
          Lt. Kaffee?




                      RANDOLPH
               (continuing)
          Lieutenant, do you have anything 
          further for this witness?



                      JESSEP
               (standing)
          Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.



                      KAFFEE
          Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you.



                      JESSEP
          I beg your pardon.

                      KAFFEE
          I'm not through with my examination. 
          Sit down.

                      JESSEP
          Colonel.

                      KAFFEE
          What's that?

                      JESSEP
               (to RANDOLPH)
          I'd appreciate it if he addressed me 
          as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've 
          earned it.

                      RANDOLPH
          Defense counsel will address the 
          witness as Colonel or Sir.

                      JESSEP
               (to RANDOLPH)
          I don't know what the hell kind of 
          an outfit you're running here.

                      RANDOLPH
          And the witness will address this 
          Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm 
          quite certain I've earned it. Take 
          your seat, Colonel.



                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          What would you like to discuss now! 
          My favorite color?

                      KAFFEE
          Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was 
          the first one off the base?

                      JESSEP
          Yes.

                      KAFFEE
          There wasn't a flight that left seven 
          hours earlier and landed at Andrews 
          Airforce Base at 2 a.m.?

                      RANDOLPH
          Lieutenant, I think we've covered 
          this, haven't we?




                      KAFFEE
          Your Honor, these are the Tower 
          Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay 
          and Andrews Airforce Base. The 
          Guantanamo log lists no flight that 
          left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews 
          log lists no flight that landed at 2 
          a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense 
          Exhibits "A" and "B".

                      RANDOLPH
          I don't understand. You're admitting 
          evidence of a flight that never 
          existed?

                      KAFFEE
          We believe it did, sir.
               (glancing at the paper, 
               then motioning to 
               the AIRMEN)
          Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil 
          O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. 
          They were working the ground crew at 
          Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.

                      ROSS
          Your Honor, these men weren't on the 
          list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, 
          called specifically to refute 
          testimony offered under direct 
          examination.




                      RANDOLPH
          I'll allow the witnesses.

                      JESSEP
          This is ridiculous.

                      KAFFEE
          Colonel, a moment ago --

                      JESSEP
          Check the Tower Logs for christ's 
          sake.

                      KAFFEE
          We'll get to the airmen in just a 
          minute, sir. A moment ago said that 
          you ordered Kendrick to order his 
          men not to touch Santiago.

                      JESSEP
          That's right.

                      KAFFEE
          And Kendrick was clear on what you 
          wanted?

                      JESSEP
          Crystal.

                      KAFFEE
          Any chance Kendrick ignored the order?

                      JESSEP
          Ignored the order?

                      KAFFEE
          Any chance he just forgot about it?

                      JESSEP
          No.

                      KAFFEE
          Any chance Kendrick left your office 
          and said, "The 'old man's wrong"?

                      JESSEP
          No.

                      KAFFEE
          When Kendrick spoke to the platoon 
          and ordered them not to touch 
          Santiago, any chance they ignored 
          him?

                      JESSEP
          Have you ever spent time in an 
          infantry unit, son?

                      KAFFEE
          No sir.

                      JESSEP
          Ever served in a forward area?

                      KAFFEE
          No sir.

                      JESSEP
          Ever put your life in another man's 
          hands, ask him to put his life in 
          yours?

                      KAFFEE
          No sir.

                      JESSEP
          We follow orders, son. We follow 
          orders or people die. It's that 
          simple. Are we clear?

                      KAFFEE
          Yes sir.

                      JESSEP
          Are we clear?

                      KAFFEE
          Crystal.




                      KAFFEE
               (continuing; beat)
          Colonel, I have just one more question 
          before I call Airman O'Malley and 
          Airman Perez: If you gave an order 
          that Santiago wasn't to be touched, 
          and your orders are always followed, 
          then why would he be in danger, why 
          would it be necessary to transfer 
          him off the base?







                      JESSEP
          Private Santiago was a sub-standard 
          marine. He was being transferred off 
          the base because --

                      KAFFEE
          But that's not what you said. You 
          said he was being transferred because 
          he was in grave danger.

                      JESSEP
               (pause)
          Yes. That's correct, but --

                      KAFFEE
          You said, "He was in danger". I said, 
          "Grave danger". You said --

                      JESSEP
          Yes, I recall what --

                      KAFFEE
          I can have the Court Reporter read 
          back your --

                      JESSEP
          I know what I said. I don't need it 
          read back to me like I'm a damn --

                      KAFFEE
          Then why the two orders?
               (beat)
          Colonel?
               (beat)
          Why did you --

                      JESSEP
          Sometimes men take matters into their 
          own hands.

                      KAFFEE
          No sir. You made it clear just a 
          moment ago that your men never take 
          matters into their own hands. Your 
          men follow orders or people die. So 
          Santiago shouldn't have been in any 
          danger at all, should he have, 
          Colonel?



                      JESSEP
          You little bastard.

                      ROSS
          Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess 
          to --

                      KAFFEE
          I'd like an answer to the question, 
          Judge.

                      RANDOLPH
          The Court'll wait for answer.

                      KAFFEE
          If Kendrick told his men that Santiago 
          wasn't to be touched, then why did 
          he have to be transferred?



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Colonel?



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't 
          he? Because that's what you told 
          Kendrick to do.

                      ROSS

          I'll ask for the forth time. You 
          ordered --

                      JESSEP
          You want answers?

                      KAFFEE
          I think I'm entitled to them.

                      JESSEP
          You want answers?!

                      KAFFEE
          I want the truth.

                      JESSEP
          You can't handle the truth!



                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          Son, we live in a world that has 
          walls. And those walls have to be 
          guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna 
          do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I 
          have a greater responsibility than 
          you can possibly fathom. You weep 
          for Santiago and you curse the 
          marines. You have that luxury. You 
          have the luxury of not knowing what 
          I know: That Santiago's death, while 
          tragic, probably saved lives. And my 
          existence, while grotesque and 
          incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
               (beat)
          You don't want the truth. Because 
          deep down, in places you don't talk 
          about at parties, you want me on 
          that wall. You need me there.
               (boasting)
          We use words like honor, code, 
          loyalty... we use these words as the 
          backbone to a life spent defending 
          something. You use 'em as a punchline.
               (beat)
          I have neither the time nor the 
          inclination to explain myself to a 
          man who rises and sleeps under the 
          blanket of the very freedom I provide, 
          then questions the manner in which I 
          provide it. I'd prefer you just said 
          thank you and went on your way. 
          Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a 
          weapon and stand a post. Either way, 
          I don't give a damn what you think 
          you're entitled to.

                      KAFFEE
               (quietly)
          Did you order the code red?

                      JESSEP
               (beat)
          I did the job you sent me to do.

                      KAFFEE
          Did you order the code red?

                      JESSEP
               (pause)
          You're goddamn right I did.






                      KAFFEE
          Please the court, I suggest the jury 
          be dismissed so that we can move to 
          an immediate Article 39a Session.  
          The witness has rights.





                      RANDOLPH
          Lt. Ross?



                      KAFFEE
               (as a friend)
          Jack.




                      RANDOLPH
          The Sergeant at Arms will take the 
          jury to an ante-room where you'll 
          wait until further instruction.




                      JESSEP
          What the hell's going on?




                      JESSEP
               (continuing; to captain)
          Captain, what the hell's going on? I 
          did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm 
          getting on a plane and going back to 
          my base.

                      RANDOLPH
          M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.





                      ROSS
          Guard the prisoner.

                      JESSEP
          What the hell --

                      ROSS
          Colonel Jessep, you have the right 
          to remain silent. Any statement you 
          do make can be used against you in a 
          trial by court-martial or other 
          judicial or administrative proceeding.  
          You have the right...



                      JESSEP
          I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
          that's what this is --
               (to Ross)
          Marine!
               (Ross keeps going)
          Marine!!
               (Ross is doing his 
               job.)
          I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
          that's what's happening? This -- I'm --
          this is funny, you know that, this 
          is --





                      JESSEP
               (continuing; to Kaffee)
          I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta 
          your head and piss in your dead skull.  
          You fucked with the wrong marine.



                      ROSS
          Colonel Jessep, do you understand 
          those rights as I have just read 
          then to you?

                      JESSEP
          I saved lives. That boy was -- there 
          was a weak link. I saved lives, you 
          hear me?




                      JESSEP
               (continuing)
          You fuckin' people.
               (beat)
          You have no idea how to defend a 
          nation.
               (continuing; to KAFFEE)
          All you did was weaken a country 
          today, Kaffee. That's all you did. 
          You put people in danger. Sweet 
          dreams, son.

                      KAFFEE
          Don't call me son.
               (beat)
          I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the 
          United States Navy. And you're under 
          arrest you sonofabitch.



                      KAFFEE
               (continuing)
          The witness is excused.







                                           SLOW DISSOLVE TO:










                      SERGEANT AT ARMS
          Ten-hut.



                      RANDOLPH
          Have the jurors reached a verdict?

                      JURY FOREMAN
          We have, sir.







                      RANDOLPH
               (reading)
          On the charge of Murder, the Members

               (continuing; reading)
          On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit 
          Murder, the Members find the 
          defendants Not Guilty.



                      RANDOLPH
               (continuing)
          On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming 
          a United States Marine, the members

          The defendants are hereby sentenced

                      SERGEANT AT ARMS
               (continuing)
          Dismissed.





                      DAWSON
          Why?

                      KAFFEE
          Harold, I'm sorry.

                      DAWSON
          Why?!

                      DOWNEY
          I don't understand. Colonel Jessep 
          said he ordered the Code Red.

                      JO
          I know, but --

                      DOWNEY
          Colonel Jessep said he ordered the 
          Code Red, what did we do wrong?

                      JO
          It's not as simple as --

                      DOWNEY
          What did we do wrong?

                      DAWSON
          We did nothing wrong.



                      SAM
          Yes you did! A jury just said your 
          conduct was unbecoming a marine. 
          What does that mean?!

                      DAWSON
          You're the lawyer.

                      SAM
          You're the marine.

                      DAWSON
          Not anymore.




                      DAWSON
               (continuing)
          I never meant to hurt Willy.




                      SERGEANT AT ARMS
          Kaffee, I've gotta take these guys 
          over to personnel for some paper 
          work.



                      SERGEANT AT ARMS
               (continuing; to Dawson 
               & Downey)
          Gentleman?










                      KAFFEE
          Harold!



                      DAWSON
          Sir!

                      KAFFEE
               (pause)
          You don't need to wear a patch on 
          your arm to have honor.



                      DAWSON
          Ten-hut.



                      DAWSON
               (continuing)
          There's an officer on deck.











                      ROSS
          Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony 
          Perez? What exactly were these guys 
          gonna testify to?

                      KAFFEE
          Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna 
          testify, under oath, that they have 
          absolutely no recollection of 
          anything.



                      ROSS
          Strong witnesses.

                      KAFFEE
          And very handsome, too, don't you 
          think?

                      ROSS
          I'll see you around the campus.  
          I've gotta go arrest Kendrick.

                      KAFFEE
          Tell him I say "Hi".

                      ROSS
          Will do.

                                                     CUT TO:






                      JO
          What do you say we take the rest of 
          the day off. Go out someplace. Sam? 
          Champagne? Yoo-Hoo?

                      SAM
          Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home 
          and talk to my daughter. I think 
          she's gotta be bilingual by now.



                      JO
          So what's next for you?

                      KAFFEE
          Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He 
          went to the movies on company time. 
          What about you?

                      JO
          Me? Oh... you know... the usual.

                      KAFFEE
          Just pretty much generally annoying 
          people?

                      JO
          Yeah.
               (pause)
          So what do you say? How 'bout a 
          celebration?

                      KAFFEE
          No. How 'bout a date. A real date. 
          Dinner. Attractive clothes. The works.

                      JO
          Sounds good.  Who do you think I 
          should call?

                      KAFFEE
          I'll pick you up at seven.

                      JO
          What are you gonna do now?

                      KAFFEE
          I'm gonna get started on Henry 
          Williamson.
               (beat)
          Stand my post for a while.



                      JO
          Wear matching socks.






                                                   FADE OUT.

                          THE END
