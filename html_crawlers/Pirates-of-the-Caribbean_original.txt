                     YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life
           for me...











                     ELIZABETH
           ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...




                     GIBBS
               (sotto)
           Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail
           these waters. You want to call
           'em down on us?



                        NORRINGTON
           Mr. Gibbs.







                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
           That will do.

                    GIBBS
          She was singing about pirates.
          Bad luck to sing about pirates,
          with us mired in this unnatural
          fog-- mark my words.

                    NORRINGTON
          Consider them marked.   On your
          way.

                    GIBBS
          'Aye, Captain.
              (as he moves off)
          Bad luck to have a woman on board,
          too. Even a mini'ture one.




                    ELIZABETH
          I think it would be rather
          exciting to meet a pirate.

                    NORRINGTON
          Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and
          dissolute creatures, the  lot of
          them. I intend to see to   it that
          any man who sails under a  pirate
          flag, or wears a pirates  brand,
          gets what he deserves: a  short
          drop and a sudden stop.




                    SWAN
          Captain Norrington... I appreciate
          your fervor, but I am concerned about
          the effect this subject will have on
          my daughter.

                    NORRINGTON
          My apologies, Governor.

                    ELIZABETH
          Actually, I find it all fascinating.

                    SWAN

          And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth,
          dear... we will be landing in Port
          Royal very soon, and beginning our new
          lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
          comport ourselves as befits our class
          and station?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, father.



                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (to herself)
          I still think it would be exciting
          to meet a pirate...









                     ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Look!   A boy! In the water!



                    NORRINGTON
          Man overboard!

                    ELIZABETH
          Boy overboard!

                    NORRINGTON
          Fetch a hook! Haul him out of
          there!






                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          He's still breathing.

                     SWAN

          Where did he come from?

                    GIBBS
          Mary mother of God ...











                    SWAN
          What happened here?

                    NORRINGTON
          An explosion in the powder magazine.
          Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

                    GIBBS
          Lot of good it did them...
              (off Swan's look)
          Everyone's thinking it! I'm just
          saying it! Pirates!

                    SWAN
          There is no proof of that. It could
          have been an accident. Captain, these
          men were protection. If there is even
          the slightest chance one of those poor
          devils is still alive, we cannot
          abandon them!

                     NORRINGTON
          Of course not, Governor.
              (to the crew)
          Come about and strike the sails! Unlash
          the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off
          the cannons!
              (to Swann)
          Hope for the best...prepare for
          the worst.
              (to two sailors)
          Move the boy aft. We'll need the
          deck clear.




                    SWAN
          Elizabeth, I want you to accompany
          the boy. He's in your charge now.
          You'll watch over him?












                    ELIZABETH
          My name is Elizabeth Swann.

                    WILL
          Will Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          I'm watching over you, Will.













                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You're a pirate.










                    NORRINGTON
          Did he speak?

                    ELIZABETH
          His name is Will Turner -- that's
          all I found out.

                       NORRINGTON
          Very good.

























                       EIGHT YEARS LATER
































                    SWANN (O.S.)
          Elizabeth? Is everything all
          right? Are you decent?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes -- yes.





                    SWANN
          Still abed at this hour?    It's a
          beautiful day!








                    SWANN (CONT'D)
          I have a gift for you.




                    ELIZABETH

          It's -- beautiful. May I inquire
          as to the occasion?

                    SWANN
          Is an occasion necessary for a father
          to dote upon his daughter with gifts?




                    SWANN (CONT'D)
          Although...I did think you could
          wear it to the ceremony today.

                       ELIZABETH (O.S.)
          Ceremony?

                    SWANN
          Captain Norrington's promotion
          ceremony.



                       ELIZABETH
          I knew it.

                    SWANN
          Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a
          fine gentleman, don't you think?
              (no answer)
          He fancies you, you know.



                       SWANN (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth?     How's it coming?






                    ELIZABETH
          Difficult ... to say.

                    SWANN (O.S.)
          I'm told that dress is the very latest
          fashion in London.

                    ELIZABETH
              (holding her breath)
          Women in London must have learned to
          not breath.






                    BUTLER
          Governor? A caller is here for
          you.








                     SWANN
          Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see
          you again!




                    WILL
          Good day, sir.
              (holds out the case)
          I have your order.





                    WILL (CONT'D)

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          The blade is folded steel. That's
          gold filigree laid into the
          handle. If I may -




                    WILL (CONT'D)

          Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly
          the full width of the blade..

                    SWANN
          Impressive. .. very impressive.
          Commodore Norrington will be pleased,
          I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to
          your master.





                    WILL
              (bows slightly)
          I shall. A craftsman is always pleased
          to hear his work is appreciated --






                    SWANN
          Elizabeth! You look stunning!




                    ELIZABETH
          Will! It's so good to see you!




                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I dreamt about you last night.
          Will reacts with surprise:
          "Really?

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth, this is hardly
          appropriate -

                    ELIZABETH
              (ignores her father)
          About the day we met. Do you
          remember?

                    WILL
          I could never forget it, Miss
          Swann.

                    ELIZABETH
          Will, how many times must I ask
          you to call me 'Elizabeth'?

                    WILL
          At least once more, Miss Swann. As
          always.




                    SWANN
          Well said! There's a boy who
          understands propriety. Now, we must be
          going.







                    ELIZABETH
          Good day, Mr. Turner.





                      WILL
          Good day.




                     WILL (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          Elizabeth.



                    SWANN
          Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit
          more decorum in front of Commodore
          Norrington. After all, it is only

          through his efforts that Port Royal has
          become at all civilized.











































                    HARBORMASTER
          If you're out rolling scuppers in
          this tub, you're either incredibly
          brave or incredibly stupid.

                    JACK
          It's remarkable how often those
          two traits coincide.





                    HARBORMASTER
          It's a shilling for the dock
          space, and you're going to have to
          give me your name.

                    JACK
          What do you say to three
          shillings, and we forget the name?




                    HARBORMASTER
          Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.







































                     MURTOGG
          This dock is off-limits to
          civilians.

                    JACK
          Sorry, I didn't know.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?
          You two weren't invited?

                     MURTOGG
          No ... someone has to make sure
          this dock stays off-limits to
          civilians.

                    JACK
          This must be some important boat.

                       MULLROY
          Ship.

                       JACK
          Ship.

                    MURTOGG
          Captain Norrington's made it his
          flagship. He'll use it to hunt
          down the last dregs of piracy on
          the Spanish Lake.

                       MULLROY
          Commodore.

                    MURTOGG
          Right. Commodore Norrington.

                    JACK
          That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it
          seems to me a ship like that --
              (indicates the Dauntless)
          -- makes this one here just a wee
          superfluous.

                    MURTOGG
          Oh, the Dauntless is the power in
          these waters, true enough -- but
          there's no ship that can match the
          Interceptor for speed.

                    JACK
          That so? I've heard of one, supposed to
          be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black
          Pearl?



                    MULLR0Y
          There's no real ship as can match
          the Interceptor.

                    MURTOGG
          The Black Pearl is a real ship.

                    MULLROY
          No, it's not.

                    MURTOGG
          Yes it is. I've seen it.

                    MULLR0Y
          You've seen it?

                    MURTOGG
          Yes.

                    MULLROY
          You've seen the Black Pearl?

                    MURTOGG
          Yes.

                    MULLR0Y

          You haven't seen it.

                    MURTOGG
          Yes, I have.

                    MULLR0Y
          You've seen a ship with black sails
          that's crewed by the damned and
          captained by a man so evil that hell
          itself spat him back out?

                     MURTOGG
          ... No .

                     MULLROY
          No.

                    MURTOGG
          But I've seen a ship with black sails.

                    MULLR0Y
          Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by
          the damned and captained by a man so
          evil hell itself spat him back out
          could possibly have black sails and
          therefore couldn't possibly be any ship
          other than the Black Pearl. Is that
          what you're saying?

                     MURTOGG
          ... no.

                    MULLR0Y
              (turns back to Jack)
          Like I said, there's no real ship
          as can match -- Hey!







                     MULLROY (CONT'D)
          You!




                    MULLROY (CONT'D)
          Get away from there! You don't
          have permission to be aboard
          there!



                    JACK
          I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty
          boat. Ship.



                    MURTOGG
          What's your name?

                       JACK
          Smith.

                    MULLR0Y
          What's your business in Port
          Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?

                    MURTOGG
          And no lies!

                    JACK
          None? Very well. You've rumbled
          me. I confess: I intend to
          commandeer one of these ships,
          pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go
          out on the account, do a little
          honest pirating.

                    MURTOGG
          I said, no lies.

                    MULLR0Y
          I think he's telling the truth.

                    MURTOGG
          He's not telling the truth.

                       MULLROY
          He may be.

                    MURTOGG
          If he were telling the truth he
          wouldn't have told us.

                    JACK
          Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
          believe the truth if he told it to you.








                    NORRINGTON
          May I have a moment?





                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
              (a burst)
          You look lovely. Elizabeth.




                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I apologize if I seem forward --
          but I must speak my mind.


                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
              (working up his
               confidence to do so)
          This promotion confirms that I have
          accomplished the goals I set for myself
          in my career. But it also casts into
          sharp relief that which I have not
          achieved. The thing all men most
          require: a marriage to a fine woman.
              (beat)
          You have become a fine woman,
          Elizabeth.

                    ELIZABETH
          I can't breathe.

                    NORRINGTON
              (smiles)

          I'm a bit nervous, myself --







                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth! .



















                    GILLETTE
          The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she
          missed them!









                    JACK
          Aren't you going to save her?

                    MULLR0Y
          I can't swim.



                    JACK
              (rolls his eyes)
          Sailors.







                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Fine.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Don't lose these.










































































                    MULLROY
          Not breathing.




                    JACK

          Move.










                    MULLROY
          I never would have thought of
          that.

                     JACK
          Clearly, you've never been to
          Singapore.






                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Where did you get this?





                    NORRINGTON
          On your feet.





                    SWANN
          Elizabeth! Are you all right?



                    ELIZABETH
          Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore
          Norrington, do you intend to kill
          my rescuer?





                    NORRINGTON
          I believe thanks are in order.








                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Had a brush-up with the East India
          Trading Company, did you ... pirate?





                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette,
          fetch some irons.




                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

                    JACK
          Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.



                    NORRINGTON
          I don't see your ship -- Captain.

                    MURTOGG
          He said he'd come to commandeer one.

                    MULLROY
              (to Murtogg)
          I told you he was telling the truth.
              (currying favor)
          These are his, sir.




                    NORRINGTON
              (to Jack)
          Extra powder, but no additional shot.





                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          It doesn't bear true.





                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I half-expected it to be made of wood.



                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Taking stock: you've got a pistol with
          only one shot, a compass that doesn't
          point north ... and no ship. You are
          without a doubt the worst pirate I have
          ever heard of.

                    JACK
          Ah, but you have heard of me.



                    NORRINGTON
          Carefully, lieutenant.




                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or
          not, this man saved my life.

                    NORRINGTON
          One good deed is not enough to redeem a
          man of a lifetime of wickedness.



                    JACK
          But it seems to be enough to condemn
          him.

                    NORRINGTON
              (smiles)
          Indeed.




                       JACK
          Finally.









                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (backing away, toward land)
          Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and
          belt, please.



                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Commodore!




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?





                    JACK
          Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?





                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Now, if you'll be very kind?



                    ELIZABETH
              (as she works)
          You are despicable.

                    JACK
          I saved your life; now you've
          saved mine. We're square.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will
          always remember this as the day
          you almost caught Captain Jack
          Sparrow.





















                    NORRINGTON
          On his heels! Gillette, bring a
          squad down from the fort!

              (to Elizabeth)
          Elizabeth, are you -

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go
          capture him.




                    SWANN
          Here, dear ... you should wear this.







                    ELIZABETH
          Thank you, Father ... and let that
          be the last of your fashion
          advice, please.






















































                    WILL
          Right where I left you.




                    WILL (CONT'D)
              (under his breath)
          Not where I left you.








                    WILL (CONT' D)
              (voice low and tight)
          You're the one they're hunting.
          The pirate.




                    JACK
          You look familiar ... Have I ever
          threatened you before?

                    WILL
          I've made a point of avoiding
          familiarity with pirates.

                    JACK
          Ah. Then it would be a shame to
          put a black mark on your record.
          So if you'll excuse me ...





                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Do you think this is wise, boy?
          Crossing blades with a pirate?

                    WILL
          You threatened Miss Swann.

                    JACK
          Only a little.








                    JACK (CONT'D)
          You know what you're doing, I'll
          give you that ... Excellent form
          ... But how's your footwork? If I
          step here -




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Very good! And if I step again,
          you step again. . .

              (continuing to step
               around the circle)
          And so we circle, circle, like
          dogs we circle. . .



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Ta!















                    JACK (CONT' D)
          That's a good trick. Except, once
          again, you are between me and the
          way out.
              (points his sword at the
               back door)
          And now you have no weapon.















                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Who makes all these?

                    WILL
          I do. And I practice with them. At
          least three hours a day.

                    JACK
          You need to find yourself a girl.
              (Will sets his jaw)
          Or maybe the reason you practice
          three hours a day is you've found
          one -- but can't get her?




                    WILL
          No. I practice three hours a day
          so that when I meet a pirate ... I
          can kill him.



























                    WILL (CONT'D)
          You cheated.

                    JACK

              (smiles; what do you expect?)
          Pirate.




                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Move away.

                       WILL
          No.

                       JACK
          Move!

                    WILL
          No. I can not just step aside and
          let you escape.




                    JACK
          You're lucky, boy -- this shot's
          not meant for you.










                    NORRINGTON
          Excellent work, Mister Brown.
          You've aided in the capture of a
          dangerous fugitive.

                    BROWN
          Just doing my civic duty.



                    NORRINGTON
          I believe you will always remember
          this as the day Captain Jack
          Sparrow almost escaped.




                    BROWN
          That ratter broke my bottle.


























                     ELIZABETH
          Nice and toasty. Thank you,
          Estrellia.




























                    PRISONER
          Come here, boy... Want a nice,
          juicy bone?



                    JACK
          You can keep doing that forever,
          that dog's never going to move.

                    PRISONER
          Excuse us if we ain't resigned
          ourselves to the gallows just yet.






                    SWANN
          Has my daughter given you an
          answer yet?

                    NORRINGTON
          No. She hasn't.

                    SWANN
          Well, she had a taxing day...
          Ghastly weather tonight.

                    NORRINGTON
          Bleak. Very bleak.



                    SWANN
          What was that?



                    NORRINGTON
          Cannon fire!







                    JACK
          I know those guns!




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          It's the Black Pearl.

                     PRISONER
              (frightened)
          The Black Pearl? I've heard
          stories ... she's been preying on
          ships and settlements for near ten
          years ... and never leaves any
          survivors.

                    JACK
          There are a lot of stories about
          the Black Pearl.




































                    NORRINGTON
          Governor! Barricade yourself in my
          office!
              (Swann hesitates)
          That's an order!








                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          They've flanked us! Men! Swords
          and pistols!



























                      PINTEL
          Up there!









                    ESTRELLA
          Miss Elizabeth?




                    ESTRELLA (CONT'D)
          Are they come to kidnap you, miss?
          The daughter of the governor would
          be very valuable.




                    ELIZABETH
          Listen, Estrella -- they haven't
          seen you. Hide, and first chance,
          run for the fort .


















































































                    PINTEL
          We know you're here, poppet. Come
          out and we promise we won't hurt
          you.




                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          We will find you, poppet ...
          You've got something of ours, and
          it calls to us!






                    PINTEL (O.S.)
          The gold calls to us!











                      PINTEL (CONT'D)
            Hello, poppet.























                      ELIZABETH
            Please, no ...








                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                (gasps it out)
            Par. .. Parlay!



                    PINTEL
          What?

                    ELIZABETH
          Parlay! I invoke the right of
          parlay! According to" the Code of
          the Brethren, set down by the
          pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,
          you must take me to your Captain!

                    PINTEL
          I know the code.

                    ELIZABETH
          If an adversary demands parley,
          you can do them no harm until the
          parlay is complete.

                    PINTEL
          It would appear, so do you.

                    SMOLDERING PIRATE
          To blazes with the code!



                    PINTEL
          She wants to be taken to the
          Captain, and she'll go without a
          fuss.



                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          We must honor the code.



































                       PRISIONER
          Praise be!



                    PRISONER (CONT'D)
              (back to Jack)
          My sympathies, friend - - you've
          no manner of luck at all!









                    JACK
          It's all right, doggie ... come
          here,










                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What's the matter, boy?







                    TWIGG
          This isn't the armory.



                    KOEHLER
              (Dutch accent)
          Well, well... Look what we have
          here, Twigg. It's. Captain
          Sparrow.

                    TWIGG
          Huh. Last time I saw you, you were
          all alone on a God-forsaken
          island, shrinking into the
          distance. I'd heard you'd gotten
          off, but I didn't believe it.

                    KOEHLER
          Did you sprout little wings and
          flyaway?

                    TWIGG
          His fortunes aren't improved much.





                    JACK
          Worry about your own fortunes. The
          lowest circle of hell is reserved
          for betrayers ... and mutineers.










                    JACK (CONT' D)
          You are cursed.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          The stories are true.



                    KOEHLER
          You know nothing of hell.






























                    BOSUN
          I didn't know we was taking
          captives.

                    PINTEL
          She's invoked the right of
          parlay... with Captain Barbossa.
















                    ELIZABETH
          I am here to --



                    BOSUN
          You'll speak when spoken to!



                    BARBOSSA
          And you'll not lay a hand on those
          under the protection of parlay!

                       BOSUN
          Aye, sir.




                       BARBOSSA

          My apologies, miss. As you were
          saying, before you were so rudely
          interrupted?

                    ELIZABETH
          Captain Barbossa ... I have come
          to negotiate the cessation of
          hostilities against Port Royal.



                    BARBOSSA
          There was a lot of long words in
          there, miss, and we're not but
          humble pirates. What is it you
          want?

                     ELIZABETH
          I want you to leave. And never
          come back.



                    BARBOSSA
          I am disinclined to acquiesce to
          your request.
              (helpfully)
          Means' No. '

                       ELIZABETH
          Very well.





                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I'll drop it!

                    BARBOSSA
          My holds are bursting with swag.
          That bit of shine matters to me
          ... Why?

                    ELIZABETH
          Because it's what you're searching
          for. You've been searching for it
          for years. I recognize this ship.

          I saw it eight years ago, when we
          made the crossing from England.

                    BARBOSSA
              (interested)
          Did you, now?



                    ELIZABETH
          Fine. I suppose if this is
          worthless, there's no reason to
          keep it.



                    BARBOSSA
          NO!



                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You have a name, missy?

                     ELIZABETH
          Elizabeth -
              (stops herself from
               saying "Swann"; then:)
          Turner.
              (embroidering)
          I'm a maid in the governor's
          household.
              (curtsies)
          Barbossa reacts to the name
          Turner: it confirms what he has
          suspected. The other pirates
          surreptitiously exchange glances
          and nods.

                    BARBOSSA
          You've got sand, for a maid.

                    ELIZABETH
              (curtsies again)
          Thank you, sir.

                    BARBOSSA

          And how does a maid come to own a
          trinket such as that? A family
          heirloom, perhaps?

                    ELIZABETH
          Of course.
              (offended)
          I didn't steal it, if that's what
          you mean.

                    BARBOSSA
          No, no, nothing like that.
              (comes to a decision)
          Very well. You hand that over,
          we'll put your town to our rudder
          and ne'er return.

                    ELIZABETH
          Can I trust you?

                    BARBOSSA
          It's you who invoked the parlay!
          Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand
          it over, now... or these be the
          last friendly words you'll hear!





                    ELIZABETH
          Our bargain. . ?



                    BOSUN
          Still the guns, and stow 'em!
          Signal the men, set the flags, and
          make good to clear port!





                    ELIZABETH
          Wait! You must return me to shore!
          According to the rules of the
          Order of the Brethren -



                     BARBOSSA
          First. Your return to shore was
          not part of our negotiations nor
          our agreement, and so I 'must' do
          nothing. Secondly: you must be a
          pirate for the pirate's code to
          apply. And you're not. And
          thirdly...


































                    WILL
          Miss Swann! Elizabeth!








                     WILL
          They've taken her! They've taken
          Elizabeth!






                    NORRINGTON
          We're aware of the situation.

                    WILL
          We have to hunt them down -- and
          save her!



                    SWANN
          Where do you propose we start? If
          you have any information that
          concerns my daughter, then share
          it! If anyone does, tell me!
              (Will is silent)
          Leave, Mr. Turner.



                    MURTOGG
          That Jack Sparrow... he talked
          about the Black Pearl.

                    MULLROY
          Mentioned it, is more what he did.

                     MURTOGG
          Still --

                    WILL
          We can ask him where it is --
          maybe he can lead us to it!

                     SWANN

          That pirate tried to kill my
          daughter. We could never trust a
          word he said!

                    WILL
          We could strike a bargain -

                    NORRINGTON
          No. The pirates who invaded   this
          fort left Sparrow locked in   his
          cell. Ergo, he is not their   ally,
          and therefore of no value.
              (through with Will)
          We will determine their most
          likely course, and launch a   search
          mission that sails with the   tide.



                    WILL
          That's not good enough. This is
          Elizabeth's life!




                    NORRINGTON
          Mr. Turner, this is not the time
          for rash actions.
              (low)
          Do not make the mistake of
          thinking you are the only man here
          who loves Elizabeth.
              (firm)
          Now, go home.















                    WILL
          Are you familiar with that ship?
          The Black Pearl?

                      JACK
          Somewhat.

                    WILL
          Where does it make berth?

                    JACK
          Surely you've heard the stories? The
          Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla
          de Mureta... an island that cannot be
          found -- except by those who already
          know where it is.

                    WILL
          The ship's real enough. So its
          anchorage must be a real place. Where
          is it?

                    JACK
          Why ask me?

                    WILL
          Because you're a pirate.

                    JACK
          And you want to turn pirate
          yourself?

                    WILL
          Never.
              (beat)
          They took Miss Swann.

                    JACK
              (he was right)
          So it is that you found a girl. Well,
          if you're intending to brave all and
          hasten to her rescue and so win fair
          lady's heart, you'll have to do it
          alone. I see no profit in it for me.





                    WILL
          I can get you out of here.

                    JACK
          How? The key's run off.

                    WILL
              (examines the cell)
          I helped build these cells. Those are
          hook-and-ring hinges. The proper
          application of strength, the door'll
          lift free. Just calls for the right
          lever and fulcrum. . .




                    JACK
          Your name is Turner.



                    WILL
          Yes. Will Turner.



                    JACK
          Will Turner...
              (he stands)
          I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've
          changed my mind. You spring me from
          this cell, and on pain of death, I'll
          you to the Black Pearl.
              (sticks out his hand)
          Do we have an accord?




                    WILL
          Agreed.

                    JACK
          Agreed!









                    WILL
          Someone will have heard that.
          Hurry.



                    JACK
          Not without my effects.

                    WILL
          We need to go!




                    WILL (CONT'D)
          Why are you bothering with that?

                     JACK
          My business, Will. As for your business
          -one question, or there's no use going.
               (joins Will at the door)
          This girl -- what does she mean to you?
          How far are you willing to go to save
          her?

                    WILL
              (no hesitation)
          I'd die for her.

                    JACK
          Good.







                    JACK (O.S.)
          Ah, now there's a lovely sight!



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report
          her. Honest men are slaves to their
          conscience, and there's no predicting
          'em. But you can always trust a
          dishonest man to stay that way...




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Come aboard.

                    WILL
          I haven't set foot off dry land I was
          twelve, when the ship I was on
          exploded.
              (regards the boat)
          It's been a sound policy.

                    JACK
          No worries there. She's far more
          likely to rot out from under us.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Besides, we are about to better
          our prospects considerably.




                    WILL
          We're going to steal a ship? That
          ship?

                    JACK
          Commandeer. We're going to
          commandeer a ship. Nautical term.

                    WILL
          It's still against the law.

                    JACK

          So's breaking a man out of jail. Face
          it, Will: you may say you'll never be a
          pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring
          start.
              (smiling)
          My advice -- smile and enjoy it.







                     WILL
          This is either crazy, or
          brilliant.

                    JACK
          Remarkable how often those two
          traits coincide.













                    JACK
          Everybody stay calm. We're taking
          over the ship!

                    WILL
              (a beat)
          Aye! Avast!








                       GILLETTE

          You're serious about this.



                    JACK
          Dead serious.

                    GILLETTE
          You understand this ship cannot be
          crewed by only two men. You'll never
          make it out of the bay.

                    JACK
          We'll see about that.




                    GILLETTE
          Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed
          or wounded in this foolish enterprise.

                    JACK
          Fine by me. We brought you a nice
          little boat, so you can all get back to
          shore, safe and sound.

                    GILLETTE
              (a curt nod)
          Agreed. You have the momentary
          advantage, sir. But I will see you
          smile from the yard arm sir.

                    JACK
          As likely as not.
              (calling)
          Will, short up the anchor, we've
          got ourselves a ship!








                    JACK
          A little help?





                    MURTOGG
          I can't believe he's doing this.



                    MULLROY
          You didn't believe he was telling the
          truth, either.



                    GILLETTE
              (over his shoulder, to Will)
          Do you have any idea, boy, what you're
          doing?



                      WILL
          No.







                    JACK
          Lookee there, mate! We're
          underway!










                    SWANN
          Commodore --

                      NORRINGTON
          A moment.

                    SWANN
          But --

                    NORRINGTON
          Please.

                    SWANN
          Dammit, man, it appears someone is
          stealing your ship!







                    NORRINGTON
          Rash, Turner, too rash.



                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          That is, without doubt, the worst
          pirate I have ever seen.






                    WILL
          They're coming!












                    NORRINGTON
          Search every cabin, every hold,
          down to the bilges!








                    JACK
          Can you swim?
              (the man struggles)
          Can. You. Swim?



                    SENTRY
          Of course, sir. Like a fish. I
          grew up summers living in Dover,
          with my uncle -

                    JACK
          Good.










                    NORRINGTON
          Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!







                    JACK
          Thank you, Commodore, for getting our
          ship ready to make way! We'd've had a
          hard time of it by ourselves!



                    NORRINGTON
          Raise the sails.

                    GILLETTE
          The wind is quarter from astern
          ... by the time we're underway,
          we'll never catch them.

                    NORRINGTON
          We need only to come about, to put
          them in range of the long nines.



                    GILLETTE
          Hands! Come about! Jackets off the
          cannons!
              (to Norrington)
          We are to fire on our own ship?

                    NORRINGTON
          Better to see it at the bottom of the
          sea than in the hands of a pirate.




                    STEERSMAN
          Captain, there's a problem.




                    STEERSMAN (CONT'D)
          He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

                    NORRINGTON
          So it would seem.




                    GILLETTE
          He's got to be the best pirate
          I've ever seen.



                    NORRINGTON
          So it would seem.

















                    PINTEL
          You'll be dining with the Captain,
          and he requests you wear this.

                    ELIZABETH
          Tell the captain that I am disinclined
          to acquiesce to his request.

                    PINTEL
              (happy)
          He said you say that! He also said if
          that be the case, you'll be dining with
          the crew, and you'll be naked.



                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
              (hands it over)
          Fine.









                    BARBOSSA
          Maid or not, it fits you.

                    ELIZABETH

          Dare I ask the fate of its previous
          owner?

                    BARBOSSA
          Now, none of that. Please dig in.




                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          No need to stand on ceremony, and no
          call to impress anyone. You must be
          hungry.




                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Try the wine.




                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          And the apples -- one of those next.




                    ELIZABETH
          It's poisoned!




                    BARBOSSA
          Oh, there would be no sense in killing
          you, Miss Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then why aren't you eating?

                    BARBOSSA
          Would that I could.



                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

          Do you not know what this is,
          then?

                    ELIZABETH
          It's a pirate medallion.

                    BARBOSSA
          It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de
          Muerta .




                    BARBOSSA (CONT 'D)
          Ah, so you don't know as much as you
          pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a
          great bloody swath through the New
          World, a high priest gave. him all the
          gold they had, with one condition: that
          he spare the people's lives. Of course,
          Cortes being Cortes, he didn't.
              (nods)
          He'd've made a great pirate, that one.




                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          So the priest, with his dying breath,
          called on the power of the blood of his
          people, and put on the gold a curse. If
          anyone took so much as a single piece,
          as he was compelled by greed, by greed
          he would be consumed.







                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Within a day of leaving port for Spain,
          the treasure ship carrying the gold ...
          something went wrong. The ship run
          aground, every man aboard dead, save
          one. He survived long enough to hide
          the gold ashore.

              (beat)
          Over time, the dark magic of the curse
          seeped into the place, making it a
          cursed island. An island of death. Isla
          de Muerta.




                    ELIZABETH
          That's all very interesting, but I
          hardly believe in ghost stories
          any more.




                    BARBOSSA
          You idiot girl! It's no make-
          believe! My crew and I, we found
          the gold, and we did more than
          take one piece, we took it all.
          Rich men we were and we spent it
          and traded it and gave it away in
          exchange

















                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          There is but one way to remove the
          curse. All of the scattered pieces
          of the treasure must be restored
          in full, and the blood repaid.

                 (he throws the pages
                  aside)
             We've recovered every piece --
             save for this.
                 (holds up the medallion)
             And as for the blood ... that's
             what we have you for.
                 (pleasant, finally
                  getting to his point)
             And that's why there's no sense in
             killing you. Yet.





                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             Apple?













                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             I'm curious -- after killing me,
             what is it you were planning to do
             next?



















                    BARBOSSA
          Look!
              (shakes her)
          LOOK! The moonlight shows us for
          what we really are! We are not
          among the living and so we cannot
          die -





                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          -- but neither are we dead! We
          have all the desires of the
          living, but cannot satisfy them!
          Ten years I have been parched of
          thirst, and unable to quench it!
          Ten years, I have been starving to
          death -- and haven't died!
              (raises his hand)

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          And I have not felt anything for
          ten years ... Not the wind on my
          face, nor the spray of the sea ...
              (reaches toward
               Elizabeth)
          ... nor the flesh of a woman ...






                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You'd best start believing in
          ghost stories, Miss Turner.
          Because now you're in one.






















                    JACK
          For a man whose made an industry
          of avoiding boats, you're a quick
          study.

                     WILL
          I worked passage   from England as a
          cabin boy.
              (an attempt  at guile)
          After my mother  passed, I came out
          here ... looking  for my father.

                    JACK
          Is that so?

                    WILL
          My father. William Turner?



                    WILL ( CONT ' D)
          I'm not a simpleton. At the jail -
          - it was only after you learned my
          name that you agreed to help.
              (a smile)
          Since that's what I wanted, I
          didn't press the matter. But now -







                    JACK
          I knew him. Probably one of the
          few who knew him as William
          Turner. Most everyone just called
          him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

                    WILL
          'Bootstrap?'

                    JACK
          Good man. Good pirate. And clever
          -"- I never met anyone with as
          clever a mind and hands as him.
          When you were puzzling out that
          cell door, it was like seeing his
          twin.

                    WILL
              (angry)
          That's not true.

                    JACK
          I swear, you look just like him.

                    WILL
          It's not true that my father was a
          pirate.

                    JACK
          Figured you wouldn't want to hear
          it.

                    WILL
          He was a merchant marine! He was a
          respectable man who obeyed the
          law, and followed the rules--

                    JACK
              (laughs)
          You think your father is the only
          man who ever lived the Glasgow
          life, telling folk one thing, and
          then going off to do another?
          There's quite a few who come here,
          hoping to amass enough swag to
          ease the burdens of respectable

          life. And they're all 'merchant
          marines.'

                    WILL
          My father did not think of my
          mother -his family -- as a burden.

                    JACK
          Sure -- because he could always go
          pirating.

                    WILL
          My father -- was not -- a pirate!




                    JACK
          Put it away, Will. It's not worth
          getting beat again.

                    WILL
          You didn't beat me. You ignored
          the rules of engagement. In a fair
          fight, I'd kill you.

                    JACK
          Then that's not much incentive for
          me to fight fair, is it?










                    JACK ( CONT ' D)
          As long as you're just hanging
          there, pay attention. Must,
          Should, do, don't, shall, shall
          not -- those are just suggestions.
          There are only two absolute rules.
              (ticks them off on his
               fingers)

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What a man can do. And what a man
          can I t do.



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          For instance: you can accept that
          your father was a pirate and still
          a good man... or you can't. Now
          me, I can sail this ship to
          Tortuga, by myself. . .
              (Will looks alarmed)
          But I can't just let you drown.













                     WILL
          Tortuga?

                    JACK
          Oh -- did I forget to mention
          that?














                     JACK

          We need a crew. We can manage the
          ship between islands, but the open
          sea, that's another matter -




                    WILL
          Just do it quickly.

                    JACK
              (rubbing his jaw)
          Don't worry. I've already got my
          Quartermaster -- there!



















                    ANAMARIA
          You stole my boat.

                    JACK
          AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I
          need to put together -




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Borrowed. Borrowed your boat.
              (off her look)
          Without permission.





                    ANAMARIA
          My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is
          it?

                    JACK
          Safe! At Port Royal. With the
          Royal Navy.

                    ANAMARIA
          That boat is my livelihood!

                    JACK
          You'll get it back. Or one better.

                    ANAMARIA
              (a threat)
          I will.





                    WILL
          Jack! Over here!




                    WILL (CONT'D)
          He knows Gibbs.


















                    GIBBS
          Curse you for breathing, you
          slack-jawed idiot
              (recognizes Jack)
          Mother's love, Jack, you know
          better than to wake a man when
          he's sleeping. It's bad luck!

                    JACK
          Well, fortunately, I know how to
          counter it. The man who did the waking
          buys the man who was sleeping a drink,
          and the man who was sleeping it drinks
          it while listening to a proposition.

                    GIBBS
          Aye, that'll about do it.




                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Blast it, I'm already awake!

                    WILL
          I know. That was for the smell.










                    JACK
          Just the one.



                    GIBBS
          Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the
          nature of this venture of yours?

                    JACK

          First -- have you found me a crew?

                    GIBBS
          Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack.
          Most of the decent pirates in town
          won't sail with you -- seem to
          think you're a jinx.

                    JACK
          Now where, I wonder, would they
          have gotten that idea?




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I'm going after the Black Pearl.





                       GIBBS
          Say again?

                    JACK
          Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I
          know where its going to be, and
          I'm going to take it.

                     GIBBS
          Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've
          heard the tales they tell about
          the Pearl.

                    JACK
          Aye, and that's why I know where it's
          going to be, and that's why I know what
          Barbossa is up to. All I need is a
          crew.

                    GIBBS
              (shakes his head)
          A fool's errand.

                       JACK

          Not if the fool has something
          Barbossa wants. Something he
          needs.

                    GIBBS
          And you've got that, have you?





                    JACK
          Back there, guarding the door is
          the son of old Bootstrap Bill
          Turner.




                    GIBBS
          Well, lookee there. I'll allow you
          may be onto something, Jack.
              (considers, nods)
          There's bound to be sailors on
          this rock crazy as you. I'll find
          some men.







                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?

                    JACK
          That he is.






                    GIBBS
          Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em
          good sea-faring men, faithful hands
          before the mast, every one worth his
          salt --

              (sotto, making his point)
          -- and crazy, to boot.





                    ANAMARIA
          You owe me a boat.







                    GIBBS
          Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor
          devil had his tongue cut out --



                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          -- so he went and trained the parrot to
          do the talking for him, nobody knows
          how. Nobody knows the parrot's name,
          neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's
          parrot.'



                    JACK
          Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage
          and fortitude to follow orders and stay
          true, in the face danger, and almost
          certain death?



                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS!

                    GIBBS
          Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'




                    JACK

          That goes for the rest of you!
          Danger and near certain death.
              (turns away)
          For we are to sail for the Isla de
          Muerta, to rescue the daughter of
          Governor Swann. An equal share of the
          reward shall be -








                    WILL
          Shut up, before you lose them all!

                    JACK
          These are the only ones worth
          having.
              (glances at the sky)
          And we're going to need them-













                    GIBBS
          That fool will have us lose the
          canvas, and the masts besides!




                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Werd best drop canvas, sirl

                    JACK
          She can hold a bit longer.



                    GIBBS
              (shouts)
          What's in your head to put you in such
          a fine mood?

                    JACK
              (shouts)
          We're catching up!


















                    TWIGG
          Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta,
          off the port bow!









                    JACOBY
          Orders, Captain?

                    BARBOSSA
          Bring her in, not too close. I won't
          brave the reef, not until high tide. We
          lay anchor before dark.



                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          ... that is, if it first doesn't
          sink back down to hell from where
          it came.















                    JACK
          Bear three points starboard.







                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Six points port!







                    GIBBS
          Left handed-ropes are coiled against
          the sun, or it's bad luck!
              (twirls a finger)
          Anty-clockwise.




                    WILL

          How do we expect to find an island no
          one can find -- with a compass that
          doesn't work?

                    GIBBS
          Now, lad, just because it don't point
          north don't mean it don't work.
              (voice low)
          That compass gives bearings to the Isla
          de Muerta, wherever it may lie.

                    WILL
          Really?
              (moves closer)
          So ... what's the story on the
          pistol?



                    GIBBS
          I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow
          has an honest streak in him, and
          that's where the whole problem
          starts. This was when he was
          Captain of the Black Pearl -

                    WILL
          What? He never told me that.

                    GIBBS
          Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things
          more close to the vest. See, Jack was a
          cartographer, back in Old England.
          Somehow I he came by the money to
          commission the Pearl. Hired himself a
          crew, promised each man an equal share.
              (lowers his voice)
          So, they're forty days out, and the
          First Mate says, everything's an equal
          share, that should mean the location of
          the island, too. So Jack gave up the
          bearings.
              (shakes his head)
          That night, there was mutiny.



                    GIBBS (CONT'D)

          Jack gave hisself up for the sake of
          his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on
          an island, left there to die.

                    WILL
          How did he get off the island?

                    JACK
              (loud)
          I didn't!



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          My body's still there, rotting
          away, and I am but a ghost!




                    GIBBS
          How did you get off the island?

                    JACK
          Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant
          tale, best left untold.



                    WILL
          Wait -- what about the pistol?

                    JACK
          The pistol. When a pirate is marooned,
          Will, he's given a pistol with a single
          shot. No good for hunting, or
          surviving, really. But after three
          weeks of starvation and thirst -- the
          option of that pistol begins to look
          good.



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          But I survived. And I still have
          that single shot. It's meant for
          one man. My mutinous first mate -

                    WILL

          Barbossa.



















                    KOEHLER
          Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.

                      BARBOSSA
          Hah!
              (to the pirates)
          Be mindful of pits and crevasses.
          Stay together.
















                    BARBOSSA
          Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd
          die and miss Judgement Day -- for not
          even the Lord himself'll come look for
          you here.










                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND
          ho!








                    ANAMARIA
          How does he do that?

                    JACK
          They'll be anchored on the lee side.
          Haul your wind, and keep to the weather
          of the island -

















                    ELIZABETH
          The curse drove you to gather
          this?

                    BARBOSSA (O.S.)

          Aye. And not a bit of it any use
          to us, only hoarded. But it will
          drive us no longer.













                    WILL
          What's that?

                     JACK
          Depends.

                     WILL
          On what?

                    JACK
          On whether the stories are    all
          true. If they are, that's    a
          waterfall that spills over    at high
          tide, with a short drop to    an
          underground lagoon. If not    -




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          -- well, too late.









                    JACK
          Chalk one up for the stories.


























                    BARBOSSA
          Here we stand before the cursed
          treasure of Cortez himself. Won by
          blood, it demands blood in return.


















                    PINTEL

             What did you expect? We're all
             gentlemen here, right and proper.




                       BARBOSSA
             You know the first thing I'm going
             to do after the curse is lifted?
                 (grins)
             Eat a whole bushel of apples.





                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             What was begun by blood, let blood
             now end!







                       KOEHLER
             Did it work?

                       DEADEYE
             I don't feel no different.

                       JACOBY
             How do we tell?





                       KOEHLER
             You're not dead.

                       JACOBY
             No.
                 (realizes)
             He shot me!

                       TWIGG

          It didn't work! The curse is still
          upon us!




                     BARBOSSA
          You. Maid. Your father. What was
          his name?!
              (grabs her roughly)
          Was your father William Turner?!



                    ELIZABETH
          No.




                    BARBOSSA
          Where's his child? The child that
          sailed from England eight years
          ago, the child who is the real
          owner of that medallion, the child
          in whose veins flows the blood of
          William Turner?! Where?




                    JACOBY
              (to Pintel)
          You brought us the wrong person!

                    PINTEL
          She had the medallion! She's the
          right age. She said her name was
          Turner!

                    TWIGG
              (to Barbossa)
          You brought us here for nothing?



                    BARBOSSA

          If you had sailed with Morgan for
          ten years like I have, you'd know
          not to question me!














                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          If any coward here dare challenge
          me, let him speak! Any more talk,
          I'll chain ye to a cannon and send
          ye to the watery depths!


















                    ELIZABETH
          You?!

                    JACK
          Me!

                    ELIZABETH
          You're in league with Barbossa!

                    JACK
          No, I'm -- rescuing you.



                      ELIZABETH
          You?!



                     WILL
          Miss Swann! We're here to rescue
          you!
               (sounds of pursuit,
                approaching)
          It's going badly!

                      JACK
          This way!








                    WILL
          I'm glad we got here in time.

                    ELIZABETH
          Truthfully -- you were a bit late.

                    JACK
          The trick isn't getting here, it's
          getting away.









                      ELIZABETH
          Come on!

                      JACK

          No. This won't work.
              (a quick decision)
          I'll stay behind, and fight them.
          You go on.



                    WILL
          No.

                    JACK
          I'll lead them away.



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Go to the opposite end of the
          island, and signal the ship. I'll
          keep 'em busy.

                    WILL
          Are you sure? Jack -- this is not
          something you have to do.

                    JACK
          I'm sure. When you've led the kind
          of life I have, there are debts
          that must be paid. Maybe I can
          balance the scales a little.














                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I invoke the right of parlay,
          according to the Code of the
          Brethren, set down by the pirates
          Morgan and Bartholomew...







                    BARBOSSA
          I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack
          Sparrow, without so much as a
          word, if you don't lose that grin
          from your face.



                    JACK
          The woman's blood didn't work, did
          it?



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I know who's blood you need, to
          end the curse.

                    BARBOSSA
          Say the name, or I slit your
          throat.

                    JACK
          No you won't.




                      PINTEL
          Now?

                      BARBOSSA (NODS)
          Now.
              (Pintel grins)
          No, don't kill him.




                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Allow me the humor of listening to
          your terms.

                    JACK
          Simple. I have something you want more
          than anything. The way to free you from
          the curse of the treasure. You have
          something I want -- more than anything.

                     BARBOSSA
          The Pearl?
              (laughs)
          Oh, that's fine. And just how do
          you expect this to work?

                    JACK
          You give me the Pearl. Then I tell
          you who you need.



                    BARBOSSA
          That's your offer? You, sailing
          away nice and pretty with the
          Black Pearl, and all I have is a
          name?

                    JACK
          That's right.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'm supposed to ... trust you?



                    JACK
          I'm a man of my word.



                    JACK (CONT' D)
          You see, I've got this honest streak in me
          -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and
          there's the fact that you have no choice.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'll torture it out of you.

                    JACK
          You left me on a desert island --
          what worse can you do?




                    BARBOSSA
          Blast you! I'll throw you in
          prison.

                    JACK
          Wait as long as you like.

                    BARBOSSA
          You're setting me up for a double
          cross, you with the ship, and me with
          nothing more than your word!

                    JACK
          Let's say I tell you the wrong
          person. What would you do?

                    BARBOSSA
          Track you down and -



                    JACK
          And if I tell you the truth, you become
          mortal, and you won't come near me
          because you know I'd kill you.





                    BARBOSSA
          Jack, I don't trust you, and
          that's a fact. Never trust a
          smiling man, you can lay to that.

                    JACK
          See, that's where we're different.
          I trust you ... to do what it
          takes to get what you want.

                    BARBOSSA
          You're playing this as close to
          the edge as any man, I'll give you
          that.
              (decides, smiles)

             We might just have to sign
             articles, you and I. Jack, you're
             a pirate at heart, that's certain.



                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             Pintel ... set sail. If this fool plan
             is to work, we'll need the medallion,
             and that means catching the ship which
             brought 'em here.




                       JACK
             What -- you don't have the medallion?

                       BARBOSSA
             That fool woman took it. You be
             careful around her, Jack -- she's
             pretty enough, she'll steal your
             heart -- but pure evil inside.

                       JACK
             I'll watch my back.

                       BARBOSSA
             Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters,
             nice and fine ... in the brig.
                 (to Jack, a smile)
             Meaning no disrespect, of course.










                       GIBBS
             Two women on board? A man don't have to
             be superstitious to know that's
             trouble.



                    ELIZABETH
          ... you were in danger ... so I took
          the medallion. And I've kept it ever
          since. They thought I was you, that
          they needed my blood. And it didn't
          work.



                    WILL
          Why would my father send this to me?

                    ELIZABETH
          To keep it away from them? No pirate
          would sail to London, for fear of
          Execution Dock.

                    WILL
          If I had known-

                    ELIZABETH
              (anticipating him)
          -- then we never would have met.





                    WILL
          I can't believe he would make such
          a sacrifice for us.

                    ELIZABETH
          I guess you can never truly know
          someone else's heart.








                    GIBBS
          Shift your heading, steer clear of that
          island. Fifteen degrees starboard.





                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell
          NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!




                    ANAMARIA
          Can we outrun them?

                    GIBBS
          Not a chance. Make for the reef.











                    PINTEL
          What's he doing? Is he going to
          run her aground?






                    GIBBS
          Drop the forward anchor!



















                    BARBOSSA
          All hands! Prepare to come about!











                    JACK
          Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill
          the lying scoundrel -
              (to Twigg)
          I'm a little conflicted, here.

















                    BARBOSSA
          Strike your colors, you bloody
          cockroaches!





                    ANAMARIA
          Looks like they mean to send us under.

                    GIBBS
          There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger,







                    GIBBS (CONT 'D)
          It's a signal. If we resist, it won't
          just be death. There'll be torture as
          well.

                    WILL
          We're not going to just surrender!









                    WILL
          We can at least fight -- we might
          be able to kill a few-

                    GIBBS
          Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for
          Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.





















                    BARBOSSA
          Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board,
          you played me right clever, make
          pretending and all. I hope your stay
          this time is more pleasant. Boys, show
          her some hospitality!







                    WILL
          She goes free!




                    BARBOSSA
          What's in your head, boy?

                    WILL
          She. Goes. Free.

                    BARBOSSA
          You've got one shot -- and we can't
          die.

                    WILL
          You can't. I can.



                       ELIZABETH
          No!



                       JACK

          Will -- don't do anything stupid!
          Don't say anything stupid -

                    WILL
          My name is Will Turner, the son of
          Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs
          in my veins.
              (raises the gun to his head)
          You need my blood. And on my word I
          will pull this trigger, and sink all
          the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!



                    TWIGG
          It's true - he's the spittin' image of
          old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!



                    BARBOSSA
          Looks like you're back to having
          nothing to offer.

                    PINTEL
          And hers got Old Bill's courage. A
          curse on him, and you!



                    BARBOSSA
          Enough of that!
              (to Will)
          Name your terms.

                    WILL
          Elizabeth goes free!

                    BARBOSSA
          We got that part. Anything else?

                    WILL
          And Jack. And the crew. Free and
          unharmed. I f you agree... then...
          I will remain with you.



                    BARBOSSA

          Agreed. You have my word, as a
          gentleman of fortune -

                    ELIZABETH
          Will -- you can't trust him.

                    WILL
          You must swear by the Holy Bible.

                    BARBOSSA
          Eh? You have my word, then -- on the
          Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord
          spare my worthless soul.






                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Boatswain! Take your captives
          belowdecks. Chain them in the galley,
          and teach 'em how to row.




                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Hah. Look there. That's the very
          same island we made Jack governor
          of on our last trip.
              (nods")
          When you sail the open sea as long as
          I, you learn to trust the signs fate
          sends your way.

                    GIBBS
              (dejected)
          Amen to that...

                    BARBOSSA
          Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my
          word and you're to be set free, right
          quick.
              (loudly)
          Men, break out the plank!




                    WILL
          No! You gave your word!

                    BARBOSSA
          Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.
          Those as know me know I wouldn't cross
          my word, and bring down bad luck on the
          ship.
              (nods)
          I agreed to set them free. I didn't say
          when. .. nor where.











                    JACK
          It's pure evil to make a Captain walk
          the plank of his own ship, twice in one
          lifetime. No good can come of it.

                    BARBOSSA
          Now, Jack. That reef is less than a
          league distant. It's a square deal all
          around, and you can't hope for better.

                    JACK
          Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.



                    BARBOSSA
          You'd best take a swim, Jack.

                    JACK
          The last time you did this, you
          left me a pistol, with one shot.



                    PINTEL
          That's proper, sir, according to the
          code.

                    BARBOSSA
          By the Powers, you're right!
              ( turns around)
          Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got
          it? Bring it forward!

                    JACK
          A gentleman might give us two pistols,
          seeing as there are two of us, this
          time.



                    BARBOSSA
          Tell you what. I'll   give you one
          pistol, and let you   be the gentleman,
          an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death
          yourself!
              (grins)
          That is, presuming   you're not both drownded.




                    BARBOSSA (CONTID)
          So how did you get off that island,
          anyway?

                    JACK
          You can go to your grave not knowing.

                    BARBOSSA
          That's fair.









                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

          The lady's next. But first, I'll be
          wanting that dress back, if you please.




                    ELIZABETH
          Here -- it will go well with your
          black heart !



                    ELIZABETH (CONT' D)
          I will not walk into the ocean.
          You'll have to throw me in!



                    BARBOSSA
          Have at her, lads!


























                    ELIZABETH
          You went back for that? We need to
          head for the reef!




                    JACK
          That's the second time I've had to
          watch that man sail away with my ship.










                    JACK (O.S.)
          Not all that big, is it?




                     ELIZABETH
          Has it changed since the last time you
          were here?

                    JACK
          The trees are taller.




                    ELIZABETH
          I hope you have no intention of using
          that.




                    JACK
          Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.



                    ELIZABETH
          Captain Sparrow! We have to get
          off this island -- immediately!

                    JACK

          Don't be thinking I'm not already
          working on it.




                    ELIZABETH
          What is that? Is there a boat
          under there?





                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          What? What's wrong? How will this
          help us get off the island?

                    JACK
          It won't. It won't, and so we
          won't.




                    ELIZABETH
          But ... you did it before! Last
          time -

                    JACK
          Last time, I was here a grand
          total of three days. Last time,
          the rumrunners who used this
          island as a cache came by, and I
          bartered passage off.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          But from the looks of this,
          they've long been'out of business,
          and so that won't be happening
          again.
              (takes another swig)
          We probably have your friend
          Norrington to thank for that.

                    ELIZABETH
          So that's it? That's the secret
          grand adventure of the infamous

          Jack Sparrow? You spent three days
          on the beach drinking rum?

                    JACK
          Welcome to the Caribbean, love.



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          You should look at our contretemps
          this way: we've got shade trees,
          thank the Lord. We've got some
          food on the trees, thank the Lord
          again. And we've got rum, praise
          the Lord. We can stay alive a
          month, maybe more. Keep a weather
          eye open for passing ships, and
          our chances are fair.

                    ELIZABETH
          A month? Will doesn't have a
          month! We've got to do something
          to help him!

                    JACK
          You're right.
              (hoists the bottle)
          Here's luck to you, Will Turner.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Don't be thinking I'm happy about
          this, Elizabeth. But I see no use
          in wailing and gnashing my teeth
          over that which I can do nothing
          about.

                    ELIZABETH
          Not when you can drink instead, at
          least.



                    JACK

          Try it. It goes down rough, but it
          goes down - - and the second swig
          goes down easier.




                    ELIZABETH
          And you will call me Miss Swann.





                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (under her breath)
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho...

                    JACK
          What? What was that?
              (Elizabeth smiles)
          Something funny, Miss Swann? share.
          Please,

                    ELIZABETH
          Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ...
          I'm reminded of a song I learned
          as a child. A song about pirates.

                    JACK
          I know a lot of songs about pirates,
          but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear
          it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Oh, no ... it's silly.   Back in
          England we didn't know   a thing
          about pirates, really.   They seemed
          so romantic and daring   -



                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (looks at him)
          That was before I met one, of
          course.

                    JACK

          Now I must hear this song. An
          authentic pirate song. Have at it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Well, perhaps ... with a bit more
          to drink, I might ...

                    JACK
          More to drink!





                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Well?




                    ELIZABETH
          We pillage, we plunder, we rifle,
          we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo
          ho.



                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          We kidnap and ravage and we don't
          give a hoot, Drink up me hearties,
          yo ho -







                    JACK/ELIZABETH
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for
          me!



                    JACK
          I LOVE this song!
              (sings)
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for
          me! We're beggars and blighters,

          ne'er do well cads, Drink up me
          hearties, yo ho!
              (gives it a touch of
               Irish ballad)
          Aye but we're loved by our mums and our
          dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!




                    JACK   (CONT'D)
          When I get the   Black Pearl back, I'm
          going to teach   it to the whole crew,
          and we'll sing   it all the time!

                    ELIZABETH
          You'll be positively the most fearsome
          pirates to sail the Spanish Main.






                    JACK
          Not just the Spanish Main. The whole
          ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we
          want to go, we go. That's what a ship
          is, you know. Not just a keel and a
          hull and a deck and sails. That's what
          a ship need_ ... but what a ship is --
          what the Black Pearl really-is ... is
          freedom.



                    ELIZABETH
          Jack, it must be so terrible for you,
          to be trapped here on this island, all
          over again.

                    JACK
          Ah, well... the company is better
          than last time. And the scenery
          has definitely improved.

                      ELIZABETH
              (coy)

          Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had
          enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

                    JACK
          We've got a few bottles left ...
          and we've yet to tap the kegs.




                    ELIZABETH
          To freedom.

                    JACK
          To the Black Pearl.























                    JACK
          What are you doing? You've burned
          our food, the shade -- the rum!

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, the rum is gone.




                    JACK

          Why?

                    ELIZABETH
          One, because it is a vile drink that
          turns even the most respectable men
          into scoundrels. Two -



                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          That signal is over a thousand feet
          high, which means it can be seen for
          two hundred leagues in every direction.
          The entire Royal Navy is out to sea
          looking for me -- do you think there is
          even a chance they could mass it?

                    JACK
          You -- you burned up the island, for a
          one-time chance at being spotted?

                     ELIZABETH
          Exactly.



                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Just you wait, Captain. In an hour,
          maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open'
          and you'll be seeing white sails on
          that horizon!

















                     JACK

          They'll be no living with her
          after this.






                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth, I'm" relieved you're
          safe.
              (re: Jack)
          Clap him in irons. And behind his
          back this time.

                    ELIZABETII
          Commodore, you can't do that!

                    NORRINGTON
          You're speaking up for him again?

                    ELIZABETH
          He can locate Isla de Muerta --
          but I doubt he'll be willing to
          help us from the brig.

                    JACK
              (she's right)
          We had time to get to know each other.

                    NORRINGTON
          We are bound for Port Royal, not
          Isla de Muerta.

                    ELIZABETH
          No. The pirates have taken Will -

                    NORRINGTON
          Your father is frantic with worry.
          Our mission was to rescue you and
          return home. That is what we shall
          do. Mr. Turner's fate is
          regrettable. But so was his
          decision to engage in piracy.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, please!

                    JACK

          Norrington, think about it ... the
          Black Pearl, its captain and
          crew... the last pirate threat in
          the Caribbean. How can you pass
          that up?

                    NORRINGTON
          By remembering that I serve
          others, not only myself.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, I beg you -- please do
          this ... for me. As a wedding
          gift.

                    NORRINGTON
          I am to understand that you will
          accept my marriage proposal on the
          condition I rescue Mr. Turner?

                    ELIZABETH
          Not as a condition -- a request.



                    NORRINGTON
          Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to
          come about. He'll give you our heading.



                    JACK
          Congratulations, sir.




                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my
          proposal.

                    ELIZABETH
          What?

                    NORRINGTON
          I know now where your heart truly
          lies.



                    ELIZABETH
          And now I know... where yours
          does, as well.




                    NORRINGTON
          You may seclude yourself in my
          cabin. I'm afraid we do not have
          any ladies' clothing aboard.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then I can wear men's clothing.

                    NORRINGTON
          That would hardly be proper.

                    ELIZABETH
          Well, I am not going to stay
          hidden in a some cabin, 80 I
          suppose it's going to be heaving
          bosoms and bare ankles for the
          remainder of the voyage!





                    NORRINGTON
          Murtogg, take our guest below, and find
          her some trousers, and a shirt.











                    PINTEL
          That ain't going to work. That's the
          gun deck above yea



                    WILL
          What happened to William Turner?

                    PINTEL
          Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He
          threw in with us after we relieved Jack
          Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned
          out, it never sat well with him-
          particularly after we found Cortes'
          treasure, and its peculiar condition.
          He thought we deserved to be cursed,
          for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we
          did. That's why he sent off a piece of
          the treasure -- to you, as it were: so
          it would never be recovered, and so
          cursed we_ remain.

                    WILL
          And then he ran. And he's hiding out
          someplace where you haven't been able
          to find him.

                    PINTEL
          That's a nice thought, to be sure, and
          I wager your da wishes he'd thought it
          hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done,
          _ didn't sit too well with Captain
          Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to
          his legs and dumped him over.



                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill,
          was his face looking up, as he
          sank down to the crushing black
          oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.
              (sighs)
          It was only after, we found out we
          needed his blood to solve the curse.
          That's what you call ironic.




                       BARBOSSA
          Bring him.







                    ELIZABETH
          You didn't tell Commodore Norrington
          everything.

                    JACK
          Nor did you, I noticed.

                    ELIZABETH
          He might delay the rescue ... and
          that would be too late.

                     JACK
          Exactly.

                    ELIZABETH
          These men will be facing an enemy
          that seemingly cannot be killed.

                     JACK
          I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any
          battle will be decidedly brief ... and
          one-sided.

                    ELIZABETH
          What's your plan?

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
          LAND HO!



                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth -- below decks. I will
          not compromise your safety..



                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my
          quarters, and make sure she stays
          there.




                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I don't like the situation, mister
          Sparrow. The island is riddled
          with caves. I will not put my men
          at a disadvantage.

                    JACK
          Funny, I was thinking   along those lines.
          How about you let me   go in alone, and
          while you're setting   up an ambush, I'll
          trick the pirates out   to you.

                    NORRINGTON
          You would do that?

                    JACK
          They left me stranded. Twice. What
          have you got to lose?

                    NORRINGTON
              (looks at him)
          Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid
          of.

                    JACK
              (smiles)
          I knew you'd listen to reason!











                    JACK
          That chart I drew up'11 get you
          past the reefs. If you're
          steersman's good enough, that is.

                    NORRINGTON
          I'll be at the wheel myself.

                    JACK
          I'll slip in, talk them into to come
          out, and you'll be free to blow holy
          high heaven the whole lot of them.








                    PINTEL
          No reason to fret. It's just a prick of
          the finger and a few drops of blood.

                     BARBOSSA
          Turner blood doesn't flow pure in
          his veins.
              (grins)
          Best play it safe, and spill it all.

                    PINTEL
          I guess there is a reason to fret.











                    BARBOSSA
          Careful, now. You could fall in and
          still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.








                    WILL
          You deserve to be cursed -- and
          remain cursed!





                    BARBOSSA
          Blast him! A pox on him, and his
          father, and the whole damnable
          line! Fan out! Find him!












                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me
          hearties yo ho!














                    JACK
          Do you have any idea where you're
          going?

                    WILL
          Jack!

                    JACK
          Don't talk. These caves magnify
          sound. Just follow me.











                    WILL
          Are you certain this is the right way?

                    JACK
          It's the right way.








                    BARBOSSA
          Thank you, Jack Sparrow.









                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You couldn't have led him back
          more directly if you knew exactly
          where you were going.




                     WILL
          You did know where you were going!
          You did lead us directly to them!
               (Jack's silence confirms it)
          Why?







                    BARBOSSA
          What was begun by blood, let blood now
          end!



                    JACK
          You don't want to be doing that.



                    BARBOSSA
          No, I really think I do.

                    JACK
              (shrugs)
          All right then.



                    BARBOSSA
          Why don't I want to do this?

                    JACK
          Because, right about now, the H.M.S.
          Dauntless is lying in wait in the
          harbor.

                    WILL
          Jack!

                    JACK
          - - and its guns and crew will cut you
          and your men to pieces the moment you
          step outside these caves.



                    PINTEL
          Do you believe him?

                    BARBOSSA
          No.
              (indicates Will)
          But him I believe. He is genuinely
          angry.

                    JACK
          You've no hope of surviving
          Norrington's attack ... that is, if
          you're mortal.

                    BARBOSSA
          What're you suggesting?




                    JACK
          Simple. Don't kill the boy yet.
          Wait for a more opportune moment.




                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (drops the coins one-by-
               one back into the chest)
          Like after you've killed... Every...
          Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.

                    BARBOSSA
          I can't help wondering, Jack, why
          you're being so helpful and all? Last
          time you did that, it didn't end 80
          well for you.

                    JACK
          The situation has changed.

                     BARBOSSA
          That so?

                    JACK
          Aye. See, after you're done with the
          Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a
          problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There
          you'll be, with two lovely ships on
          your hands, and what to do? Of course
          you'll decide you deserve the bigger
          one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless
          a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it,
          you can rule the seas.
              (beat)

          But if you're Captain of the Dauntless,
          who's left for the Black Pearl?



                     JACK (CONT'D)
          I sail for you as part of your fleet, I
          give you fifteen percent of my plunder,
          and you get to introduce yourself at
          tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore
          Barbossa.'
              (sticks out his hand)
          Do we have an accord?



                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Now, you can take care of the
          Dauntless, right?

                    BARBOSSA
          Men! Are you up for it?



                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Mr. Pintel, select five men to
          stay here. Take the rest of the
          men out ... not through the caves.



                    JACK
          There's ... another exit?

                    BARBOSSA
          Aye, for us there is.































































                    TALL SAILOR
          Ship rats. Big ones.

                    SHORT SAILOR
              (nods)
          Hate those things.




                    SHORT SAILOR (CONT'D)
          Taste all right, though.

                    TALL SAILOR
          That they do.


















                    PINTEL
          Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns
          on the beach, and set your aim. Wait
          for my signal, we don't want to spook
          them.
























                      SKINNY
            Which would you prefer first, good
            sir -rum, or wine?

                      BIG-BONES
            I believe I'll have a spot o' rum, if
            you don't mind, and thank'ee kind sir!













                      GILLETTE
            All the men in place, sir. Ready to
            fire.

                      NORRINGTON
            Wait for my order -- what the blazes is
            that?




                      NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
            Men! Take cover!







                    WILL
          You've been planning this from the
          beginning. Since you learned my name.



                    JACK
          Oh, please -- do I really seem that
          clever?





                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Use it well.




                    BARBOSSA
          Confound it, Jack -- I was
          actually beginning to like you!















                    NORRINGTON
          Steady, men! Remember -- we're the
          Navy!









                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          What is happening out there?
















                    GILLETTE
          They're on our side! Take heart, men!








                    BARBOSSA
          Just so you know, Jack -- I don't
          think you're that clever. I think
          you're a fool. A mortal fool.

                    JACK
          Remarkable how often those two
          traits coincide.



                    BARBOSSA
          You can't beat me, Jack.










                    WILL
          Jack!





                    JACK
          Well, isn't that interesting.




                    JACK (CONT' D)
          They're so pretty, I just couldn't
          resist stealing one. It's a curse,
          I guess.




                    BARBOSSA
          So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we
          to be two immortals, locked in
          epic battle until the trumpets of
          Judgment Day?

                    JACK
          Or you could surrender.




                    BARBOSSA
          Or I could chain you to a
          cannonball and drop you in the
          deepest part of the ocean, where
          you can contemplate your folly
          forever.








                     BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Hah. Ten years you carried that
          pistol, and you end up wasting
          your shot.

                    WILL
          He didn't waste it.







































                    WILL
          Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever
          heard of.
              (smiles)
          You're a man who can be trusted, who
          can be counted on, and who can It
          betray his friends. What kind of pirate
          is that?

                     JACK
              (admits it)
          The worst.
              (beat)
          On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who
          can't pass up a chance for revenge
          against the black-hearted bastard who
          stole my ship and left me to die in the
          middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and
          who knows how to get what he wants. Now
          that's a great pirate.












                    WILL
          Let's get out of here.






                    ELIZABETH
          You're all right!








                    WILL
          Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers?
          And how did you get off the island?




                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for
          how we got off the island -- ah, that's
          a grand adventure, but now is not the
          time to talk about it.



                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          There. And don't you dare tell me
          that wasn't a proper kiss!

                    WILL
          Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter-
          that we are of a different class -

                    ELIZABETH
          It doesn't!

                    WILL
          -- but that was not a proper kiss.



                    WILL (CONT'D)
          This is a proper kiss.






                    JACK
          Tough luck. I was rooting for you.










                      NORRINGTON
          ...and though I do say so with
          regret, the law is clear. The
          penalty for piracy is death by
          hanging.




                    SWANN
          By your leave, I wish to speak on
          behalf of the boy.
              (a glance at Elizabeth)
          It is clear that these deeds were
          performed out of a sincere desire   to do
          good, at great personal risk. It   seems
          to me, that in the rare occasion   where
          the right course is committing an   act
          of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the
          right course!
              (cheers of approval)
          So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend
          to grant a pardon to --

                    GILLETTE
          Sir!



                    GILLETTE (CONT'D)
          Jack and his crew have escaped!
              (gasps from the crowd)
          There was no damage to the cell ...
          they must have been set free.





                    SWANN
          The Black Pearl!










                    GILLETTE
          Sir! Shall I break out the
          cannons?

                    NORRINGTON
          I don't think that will be necessary.



                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          A day's head start. That's all he gets.







                    ANAMARIA
          Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl
          is yours!

          Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -
          you and Cotton. I want every inch of
