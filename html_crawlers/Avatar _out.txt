JAKE	 (a hoarse whisper) Are we there?	MED TECH	 We're there, Sunshine.	MED TECH	 People, you have been in cryo for five years, nine months and twenty two days. You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience. The staff thanks you in advance.			Avatar 
JAKE	 Damn.   They got big.	NORM	 Yeah, they mature on the trip out. (to Max) So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well.	MAX	 Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin.	JAKE	 It looks like him.	Avatar 
NORM	 Yeah. You just need to get in the habit of documenting everything -- what you see, what you feel -- it's all part of the science. Good science starts with good observation.	JAKE	 Right. (to camera) So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science. (looks around) Never been in a lab before.	MAX	 Log off. It's time to meet your boss for the next five years.			Avatar 
NORM	 Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote the book -- I mean literally wrote the book -- on Pandoran botany.	MAX	 (low, over his shoulder) That's because she likes plants better than people.	GRACE		(YELLING)	 Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!	Avatar 
GRACE	 Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?	NORM	 (Na'vi, subtitled) May the All Mother smile upon our first meeting.					Avatar 
MAX	 Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----	GRACE	 (turning to Jake) Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother. (to Max) You know -- the PhD who trained three years for this mission.	JAKE	 He's dead. I know it's a big inconvenience to everyone.	GRACE	 How much lab training have you had?   Ever run a gas chromatograph?	Avatar 
JAKE	 High school chemistry.   But I ditched.	GRACE	 You see? You see? They're pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain. (turning away) I'm going to Selfridge.	MAX	 Grace, that's not a good idea.	MAX	 Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.   Try to	Avatar 
MAX	 That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity.	GRACE	 Go figure. (walking away) Alright, I'm going in.	TECH	 Phase-lock at forty percent.    He's in transition.	MAX	 That's it.     Find your way home.	Avatar 
JAKE	 Yeah, no problem.	TRUDY	 See ya on the flight-line, zero nine. (she points) He's down there.	QUARITCH	 This low gravity makes you soft. (pushing the last rep) You get soft, Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.	QUARITCH	 I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela -- that was some mean bush. Nothing like this here, though. You got heart kid, coming out here.	Avatar 
TRUDY	 See ya on the flight-line, zero nine. (she points) He's down there.	QUARITCH	 This low gravity makes you soft.

You got heart kid, coming out here.	JAKE	 I figured -- just another hellhole.	Avatar 
JAKE	 Just Marines comparin' tattoos.	GRACE	 (not buying it) Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --	GRACE	 -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That means you're in my world, got it?	JAKE	 Got it.	Avatar 
GRACE	 That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this -- (indicating link room) -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore.	JAKE	 Then how's this supposed to work?	GRACE	 We have a new face. (turning to Norm) You're fluent, you've studied the culture. You're non-threatening. The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good.			Avatar

The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good.	NORM	 This is failing as a pep talk.	JAKE	 How do we contact them?	Avatar 
JAKE	 How do we contact them?	GRACE	 We don't. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- (pointedly to Jake) Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us.	JAKE	 Or they may skin us and make a drum.	GRACE	 Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.	Avatar 
GRACE	 Stay with the ship. (for Jake) One idiot with a gun's enough.	WAINFLEET	 Whatever you say, Doc.	WAINFLEET				Avatar 
(GRIMLY)	 The Na'vi learned as much about us as they needed to know.	JAKE	 (turning to her) What happened here?	GRACE		(SHARPLY)	 Are you going to help with this gear? We've got a lot to do.	Avatar 
JAKE	 Wait, don't --	NEYTIRI	 (in Na'vi) Forgive me, my brother.	JAKE	 Look, um, I know you probably don't understand this. But -- thanks. Thank you. I owe you.	NEYTIRI	 (in Na'vi) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother.	Avatar 
JAKE	 Look, um, I know you probably don't understand this. But -- thanks. Thank you. I owe you.	NEYTIRI	 (in Na'vi) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother.	JAKE	 I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along --	JAKE	 Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?	Avatar 
NEYTIRI	 No. You go back.	JAKE	 (off her amazed look) What?	JAKE	 What are they?	NEYTIRI	 Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree -- very pure spirits.	Avatar 
NEYTIRI	 My father is deciding whether to kill you.	JAKE	 Your father!? (to Eytukan) Uh, good to meet you, sir.	MO'AT		(NA'VI)	 Step back!	Avatar 
JAKE	 Who's Eywa?	MO'AT	 (thick accent) What are you called?	JAKE	 Jake Sully.	MO'AT	 Why did you come to us?	Avatar 
JAKE	 What's going on?   What are they saying?	MO'AT	 (to Neytiri, subtitled) Daughter. You will teach him our way, to speak and walk as we do.					Avatar 
JAKE	 Okay, again, a whole lot slower.	NEYTIRI	 (exaggerated slowness) Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.	JAKE	 Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.			Avatar 
JAKE	 Wha --? Oh.	GRACE	 Damn, you were dug in like a tick. (she helps him sit up) Is the avatar safe?	JAKE	 (huge grin) Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to			Avatar 
GRACE	 Damn, you were dug in like a tick. (she helps him sit up) Is the avatar safe?	JAKE	 (huge grin) Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to					Avatar 
MAX	 That's awesome, Jake.	GRACE	 (to Jake, getting serious) For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us					Avatar 
QUARITCH	 Jarhead clan? (he laughs) And that worked?	JAKE		(GRINNING)	 Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I can learn to be one of them.			Avatar 
SELFRIDGE	 Their damn village is sitting right over the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction. Which sucks -- for them -- because they need to relocate.	JAKE	 (taking that in) Does Augustine know about this?	SELFRIDGE	 Yeah, she does, and she's on the next ship back if she tries to cock-block me on it.	JAKE	 So -- who talks them into moving?	Avatar 
JAKE	 Tsu'tey. (next photo) Mo'at. (next photo) Eytukan.	GRACE	 He's the clan leader -- (indicating Mo'at) -- but she's the spiritual leader.   Like a shaman.					Avatar 
GRACE		(QUIETLY)	 No, she's dead. (turning to him) Okay, let's go -- village life starts early.	MAX	 Link is ready.	GRACE	 Don't do anything unusually stupid.	Avatar 
TSU'TEY	 You should go away.	JAKE	 (to Neytiri) I knew this guy could speak English.					Avatar 
GRACE	 That's right.	NORM	 Yesssss! (off Jake's look) The legendary Floating Mountains of					Avatar 
JAKE	 Hey. You got a problem?	NORM	 I trained three years for this mission. I speak the language fluently. (he points at Jake) He falls off the frickin' turnip truck and all of a sudden he's cultural ambassador!?	GRACE	 It's not our choice, Norm.	NORM	 Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash the dishes while you're on some interspecies booty call.	Avatar 
GRACE	 No -- now, when it's fresh.	JAKE	 Yeah, yeah. (to camera) The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Repetition.	THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:		JAKE	 Seyri.	Avatar 
JAKE (V.O.)	 I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning.	GRACE	 (Na'vi, subtitled) I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.	NEYTIRI	 I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.	JAKE (V.O.)	 I'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.	Avatar 
(SMIRKING)	 I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on the final.	GRACE	 (without looking up) This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes.	JAKE	 Excuse me -- this is my video-log here, okay?			Avatar 
JAKE	 That's right, Grace. This is what I've been working for.	GRACE	 And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine. You're getting in way too deep. (she turns away) Trust me, I learned the hard way.	JAKE	 What did happen at the school?	GRACE	 Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped coming to school. She was angry about the clear-cutting.	Avatar 
JAKE	 Sorry.	TSU'TEY	 Your warriors -- hide inside machines -- fight from far away. (he looks at Jake) I did not think a sky person could be brave.	NEYTIRI	 You must dance! It is the way.			Avatar 
JAKE	 It's the last door -- I'm going through it. You can help me or get out of the way.	GRACE	 (grabbing him) Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Na'vi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death.	GRACE (CONT'D)	 And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm- - we have no idea what that'll do in an avatar brain.	NORM	 Calibrating. Thirty seconds.	Avatar 
NORM	 Calibrating. Thirty seconds.	GRACE	 No matter what you prove out there-- you are still in here. (shaking him) Right here.	JAKE	 I have to go all the way -- become one of	THEM--		Avatar 
GRACE	 Jake. You can't carry this burden much longer.	JAKE	 (smiling wanly) It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt anyway.	GRACE	 (to Norm)			Avatar 
JAKE	 (smiling wanly) It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind probably can't survive the Dream Hunt anyway.	GRACE	 (to Norm)					Avatar 
JAKE	 Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping.	NEYTIRI	 This body is real. (she touches his forehead) This spirit is real.	NEYTIRI	 When I was first your teacher, I hated all Sky People. But you have also taught me.	(WHISPERING)	 Spirit is all that matters.	Avatar 
OPERATOR	 Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my blade here. ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable.	SUPERVISOR	 (to Selfridge) What do we do?	SELFRIDGE	 Roll on. He'll move. These people have to learn that we don't stop.			Avatar 
TSU'TEY	 You do not speak here!	JAKE	 (to Neytiri, low) Okay, listen. There's something I have to tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just need you to --	TSU'TEY	 You!	TSU'TEY	 You mated with this woman?!	Avatar 
QUARITCH	 Shut your fucking hole!	GRACE	 Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? (to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog!	SELFRIDGE	 Can we just take this down a couple notches, please.	JAKE	 (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her.	Avatar 
SELFRIDGE	 Can we just take this down a couple notches, please.	JAKE	 (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her.	GRACE	 (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.	SELFRIDGE	 You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern.	Avatar 
JAKE	 (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her.	GRACE	 (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.	SELFRIDGE	 You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern.	GRACE	 I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here -- I'm talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest.	Avatar 
(FRUSTRATED)	 Which is what exactly?	GRACE	 (to Jake) I can't do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate?	JAKE	 Just tell him what you know in your heart.	GRACE	 Alright, look -- I don't have the answers yet, I'm just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know -- is that there's some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora --	Avatar 
JAKE (RECORDED)	 They're never going to leave Hometree.	QUARITCH	 Since a deal can't be made -- it gets real simple. (to Jake, icily) So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I might just give you a big wet kiss.	GRACE	 Parker, we have to talk, like rational people.	SELFRIDGE	 Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately you're out of here on the next shuttle. All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar Program, effective now.	Avatar 
JAKE	 Yes.	(ANGUISHED)	 At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love-- with the forest, with the Omaticaya People -- (he looks at her) -- with you. And by then, how could I tell you?	NEYTIRI	 I trusted you, Jake!	JAKE	 Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --	Avatar 
QUARITCH	 Fire.	EYTUKAN	 (yelling/subtitled) Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.	MO'AT	 You are one of us.   Help us!	JAKE	 We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the columns.	Avatar 
GUARD	 They get steak?    That's bullshit. Let me see that --	TRUDY	 Oops. (shoving him down) All the way down, pendejo.	MAX	 That was unexpectedly satisfying.	NORM	 Baby, you rock.	Avatar 
NORM	 Baby, you rock.	JAKE	 (to Max and Trudy) Thanks.	JAKE	 So what do you say?    Time for a revolution?	GRACE	 I'm free.	Avatar 
NEYTIRI	 I See you.	JAKE	 (a hoarse whisper) I See you.	NEYTIRI	 I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm not any more.			Avatar 
JAKE	 (SUBTITLED) Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the People. (then just for Tsu'tey) You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best warrior. I can't do this without you.	TSU'TEY	 I will fly with you.	JAKE	 Ireiyo.			Avatar 
JAKE	 Look where we are, Grace.	GRACE	 (with a wan smile) I need to take some samples.	MO'AT		(QUIETLY)	 The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is --	Avatar 
JAKE	 I will.	GRACE	 I'm with her Jake -- (an amazed whisper) -- she's real --	JAKE	 Grace!	MO'AT	 Her wounds were too great, there was not enough time. She is with Eywa now.	Avatar 
NORM	 Holy shit.	JAKE	 (to Max) Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way.	MAX	 No, Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling and there's no stopping him.	JAKE	 When?	Avatar 
KABOOM!!		QUARITCH	 There it is. (into his headset) Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is in sight.	TROOPER	 Target in sight.	JAKE	 We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what it takes.	Avatar 
WAINFLEET	 A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I want -- (screaming on the comm) Who's screaming God damn it?!	TROOPER (ON RADIO)	 We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in charge, call for extraction!	WAINFLEET	 Shutup you crybabies!			Avatar 
QUARITCH	 (to the pilot) Put your mask on.	JAKE	 (into his headset) Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him, anybody that can! Do it now!	TRUDY	 On it.	NORM	 No!	Avatar
