CAROL	 Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.	SPENCER (O.S.)	 (softly) Grandma, grandma...	YOUNG MAN	 Maybe you better check.	CAROL	 Like what did you think I was going to do?	As Good As It Gets 
BEVERLY	 I'm sorry. I was hearing just everything you were doing so I put these on to give you privacy. INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT (breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged into the tiny space.	SPENCER	 I'm sorry.	CAROL	 Don't be silly. How bad?			As Good As It Gets 
YOUNG MAN	 Don't apologize.	CAROL	 (perturbed) That wasn't an apology.	CAROL	 Hey...  this is just a little throw- up -- it's nothing to be so embarrassed about. Really. (as he shifts uncomfortably) Thanks for the dinner. Let me write down which trains you take to get back.	YOUNG MAN	 No way.	As Good As It Gets 
EVAN	 Why is every customer surprised I read books?	DOUG	 (amazed) You read books?	EVAN	 Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! He even bought me dinner.	CARL	 (slightly exasperated) Look, I just can't. I promised Simon I'd find him a model.	As Good As It Gets 
EVAN	 Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! He even bought me dinner.	CARL	 (slightly exasperated) Look, I just can't. I promised Simon I'd find him a model.	FRIEND (V.O.)

SIMON	 (taken aback) This isn't a nude.	VINCENT	 Just kidding around. (then mutters) So much for love.					As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Exactly what is your previous experience?	VINCENT	 How about that pose? (sing-song) This is not fun... (then) Give me some direction.	SIMON	 Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.	VINCENT	 (trying another space) The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.	VINCENT	 (trying another space) The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?	SIMON	 No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.	VINCENT	 I know exactly what you mean.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.	CAROL	 (reluctant forgiveness) Okay.	CAROL	 What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?	MELVIN	 I see the help -- judgement call.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?	MELVIN	 (caught) No.	CAROL	 An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.	MELVIN	 His name?	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Okay.	CAROL	 (quietly) Spence.					As Good As It Gets

MELVIN	 How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.	RAY	 (stunned) What?	MELVIN	 Just move on. No one here killed him.	RAY	 Oh, is he dead?	As Good As It Gets 
SWEET-FACED WOMAN	 Oh, Lord -- I've got all these antique knick-knacks...  Or else I'd be glad...	FRANK	 Maybe if you kept locked in the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.

Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."	MELVIN	 (quietly) I'm not saying nothing to you.	As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second.

MELVIN (O.S.)	 Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. (calls after Frank) I can't take a dog. (a confession) Nobody's ever been in here before.	FRANK (O.S.)	 (threatening) You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.					As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 (into phone) Put the solid red dots on three of them and the hold blue dots on two others...  Well, we're not going to sell anything if they know we're two weeks into a show and have no sales. No, you can't reduce a price at this stage...  We're in free fall here. Any calls?	JACKIE	 We can see him.	FRANK	 I'll meet you in there.			As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 That bad, huh?	FRANK	 Hey, hey... (as he sees him) Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...	SIMON	 Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?	JACKIE	 (a small voice) No.	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?	JACKIE	 (a small voice) No.	JACKIE	 Wait, I have a smaller one.	SIMON	 So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?	FRANK	 (sheepish) Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.	SIMON	 (suddenly alive and upset) How could you do that? He'll hurt him.	FRANK	 No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.	As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 (sheepish) Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.	SIMON	 (suddenly alive and upset) How could you do that? He'll hurt him.	FRANK	 No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.	SIMON	 You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?	MELVIN	 (quickly) Otherwise, you're not ugly.	CAROL	 (laughs out loud) Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.	MELVIN	 What's with the dark?	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 (quickly) Otherwise, you're not ugly.	CAROL	 (laughs out loud) Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.	MELVIN	 What's with the dark?	CAROL	 Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. My son had a full blown attack. And this time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics, so I get him home...	As Good As It Gets 
ANOTHER ANGLE		FEMALE PASSERSBY	 (charmed) Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like that.	MELVIN	 (all smiles to Verdell) Let's go home and do some writing.			As Good As It Gets 
FEMALE PASSERSBY	 (charmed) Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like that.	MELVIN	 (all smiles to Verdell) Let's go home and do some writing.					As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...	MELVIN	 (leaping at the chance) It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.	FRANK	 No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.	MELVIN	 (too loudly, weirdly) Okay by me.	As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.	MELVIN	 (too loudly, weirdly) Okay by me.					As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...	SIMON	 (interrupting) Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?	SIMON	 Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart? (to Melvin) By the way, thanks for saving me.	MELVIN	 I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.	SIMON	 (not listening) Verdell?	ON VERDELL		SIMON	 Hi, sweetheart.	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 No. Please, don't force him.	JACKIE	 (to dog) You little stinker. He's given you everything.					As Good As It Gets 
DOCTOR	 I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --	MELVIN	 (suddenly) You changed the room around...	DOCTOR	 Two years ago...	DOCTOR	 I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?	DOCTOR	 Yes. (as Melvin starts for the office) No.					As Good As It Gets 
CHERYL	 What the heck do you mean?	MELVIN	 Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait. (as she doesn't budge; he screams) Do it!!!	MANAGER	 Out. Be silent or leave.	MELVIN	 I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. No problem. Get her here -- have her get me two sausages, four bacon, two eggs over easy and coffee. I'm not a prick here -- I'm a great customer. This day is a disaster. I can't handle this, too.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 I'm hungry. (on Carol's astonished look) You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.	CAROL	 What are you doing here?	MELVIN	 This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...			As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.	MELVIN	 (uncomfortably) How ya doing?	MELVIN	 (miffed) You should answer when someone talks to you...	CAROL	 Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, and I can't handle you teaching my son manners.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 (calling back) I owe you three dollars.	MELVIN	 Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?	CAROL	 (furiously) No!!! Stay away from me!			As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?	CAROL	 (furiously) No!!! Stay away from me!					As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Sorry. What are those cards?	JACKIE	 (a bit embarrassed) Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.	SIMON	 (scared shitless) Terrify me?	JACKIE	 See, he's right. I need the cards. (reading from cards) Simon, you're broke.	As Good As It Gets

SIMON	 (to Verdell) Here, baby...  what is it, Verdell?...  You miss the tough guy... (trying to be Melvin-like) Well, here I am, you little pissant mop, happy to see me? How about another ride down the chute? Oh, God...  I don't mean it, sweetheart... (on Jackie's look) I'm sorry. I know...	JACKIE	 Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that -- (reading from card) -- as a businessman, with limited resources...	SIMON	 I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...

MELVIN (O.S.)	 I need this. Just say, "Melvin, I'll try," okay?	FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)	 (resigned) Melvin, I'll try.	FEMALE EXECUTIVE	 Now, on a pleasant note, our son got accepted at Brown. My husband...	MELVIN	 (curtly) Great, wonderful. I don't need you to wait with me.	As Good As It Gets 
FEMALE EXECUTIVE	 Now, on a pleasant note, our son got accepted at Brown. My husband...	MELVIN	 (curtly) Great, wonderful. I don't need you to wait with me.	ZOE	 I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.	MELVIN	 What's it mean?	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 What's it mean?	ZOE	 That somebody out there knows what it's like to be... (taps her head and heart) in here.	MELVIN	 Oh God, this is like a nightmare.	ZOE	 Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?	As Good As It Gets 
ZOE	 How do you write women so well?	MELVIN	 (as he turns toward her) I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.					As Good As It Gets 
DR. BETTES	 He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.	CAROL	 (overlapping) Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.	SPENCER	 (to his mother) Hi... (they kiss) Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?	CAROL	 No, I didn't.

MELVIN	 What needs clearing up?	CAROL	 (strong and true) I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.	MELVIN	 I'm sorry. We don't open for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.	CAROL	 I'm not kidding.	As Good As It Gets

CAROL	 I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?	BEVERLY	 Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little... (struts and pumps her arms) You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.	CAROL	 (more emotionally than she intended) I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.

It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...	As Good As It Gets 
BEVERLY	 Go ahead.	CAROL	 (great, forceful hand gestures) ... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. (this next one's tough) Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. (weeps at her insight) Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?	BEVERLY	 Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...	CAROL	 Leave me be! Why are you doing this?

CAROL	 (to Sean) We're going out.	SEAN	 (looking at their red eyes) Looks like fun.	CAROL	 Okay -- we're out of here. I love you.	CAROL	 Do you love me?	As Good As It Gets 
LISA	 You almost have me liking him. You sure come from the heart. I never knew what you went through with everything.	CAROL	 I wanted him to know how much he'd done. (looking over) Can you believe he's eating with someone.	ON MELVIN & FRANK		MELVIN	 It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 What's this?	CAROL	 (sotto) A thank-you note for what you did for me.	FRANK	 She's nice.	MELVIN	 (to Frank) Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'	As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 She's nice.	MELVIN	 (to Frank) Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'	FRANK	 It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.	FRANK	 What?	As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?	MELVIN	 (loudly) Like the wind but I'm not doing it.	CAROL	 Getting loud, getting loud.	MELVIN	 He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Hey, what I did for you is working out?	CAROL	 (a breath; then) What you did changed my life.	MELVIN	 No... no thank you notes.	CAROL	 Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Lovely.	CAROL	 I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that. (reading from the letter, Melvin wildly uncomfortable) I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...	CAROL	 ... and I'm sorry for never spotting, right there at the table in the restaurant, the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us... You know what, I'm just going to start from the beginning... I have not been able to express my gratefulness to you... even as I look at the word "grateful" now it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel for you...	MELVIN	 Nice of you... thank you.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Bettes tells me he's doing fine.	CAROL	 (no other way) Melvin, I'd rather not.	MELVIN	 What's that got to do with it?	CAROL	 Funny, I thought it was a strong point.	As Good As It Gets 
INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER		CAROL	 (furiously exasperated) There's not way to pack for this trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm not packing the camera.					As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.	MELVIN	 Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. (correcting himself) That you might ask -- I'm not certain.	CAROL	 There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.	MELVIN	 Oh. (a beat) We might. Yes. We can. Let's.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.	MELVIN	 Oh. (a beat) We might. Yes. We can. Let's.	CAROL	 Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?	MELVIN	 Whether crabs are in season there now...	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 (to Spencer) You stand there and I'll wave to you from the back window.	BEVERLY	 Call me as soon as you're settled.	CAROL	 (to Spencer) I love you.			As Good As It Gets 
BEVERLY	 Call me as soon as you're settled.	CAROL	 (to Spencer) I love you.	CAROL	 (to bus driver) Sensitive, huh?!			As Good As It Gets 
VETERINARIAN	 Certainly.	MELVIN	 (pointing to Chihuahua) Put him in with that one, not that one... (pointing to large dog) ... Builds his confidence.					As Good As It Gets 
FRANK	 I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.	SIMON	 (upset) So am I, Frank.	MELVIN	 Soak it up -- it's your last chance at a hug for a few days.	CAROL	 Hi.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 I was going to do that for you.	CAROL	 (taken aback) It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?	MELVIN	 (totally non-plussed) I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.	CAROL	 (to Simon) Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 (taken aback) It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?	MELVIN	 (totally non-plussed) I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.	CAROL	 (to Simon) Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.	SIMON	 That's very thoughtful.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 (totally non-plussed) I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.	CAROL	 (to Simon) Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.	SIMON	 That's very thoughtful.	MELVIN	 Never a break. Never.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.	SIMON	 (during the above) I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.	MELVIN	 Doesn't matter. She's enjoying herself. Consider it part of the music.			As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Okay. Well, one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when I was nine -- and he just started screaming at her -- at us -- at evil. And...	MELVIN	 (very quickly) ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.	CAROL	 Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.	SIMON	 I was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way. I said, "she's not naked -- it's art." And then he started hitting me. And he beat me unconscious. After that he talked to me less and less -- he knew before I left for college, my dad came into my room. He held out his hand. It was filled with money. A big wad of sweaty money. (gathers himself) And he said to me, "I don't want you to ever come back." I grabbed him and I hugged him... He turns and walked out.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.	SIMON	 I was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way.

(gathers himself) And he said to me, "I don't want you to ever come back." I grabbed him and I hugged him... He turns and walked out.	CAROL	 Well, you know -- I still stay what I said. You've got to get past it all when it comes to your parents. We all have these horror stories to get over.	MELVIN	 That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Not it at all, really.	MELVIN	 (a veteran's irony) Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.					As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...	CAROL	 (to Simon) No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?	MELVIN	 Yes... sure. (to Simon) I'll take the sofa.	CAROL	 (into phone) Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you out of breath? You did?!? That is great... So great... So -- no, wait a second, Spence...	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 (to Simon) No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?	MELVIN	 Yes... sure. (to Simon) I'll take the sofa.	CAROL	 (into phone) Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you out of breath? You did?!? That is great... So great... So -- no, wait a second, Spence...			As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Yes... sure. (to Simon) I'll take the sofa.	CAROL	 (into phone) Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are you out of breath? You did?!? That is great... So great... So -- no, wait a second, Spence...					As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 You consider your life easy.	MELVIN	 I give you that one... (eyes suitcase) Nice packing.					As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 I can't, I'm exhausted.	CAROL	 (to Simon) I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?	SIMON	 No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.	CAROL	 What a nice compliment.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.	CAROL	 You promised a nice place -- can't you just... (to Head Waiter) You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?	HEAD WAITER	 Actually, I don't think so.	MELVIN	 (to Carol) Wait here.	As Good As It Gets 
HEAD WAITER	 Actually, I don't think so.	MELVIN	 (to Carol) Wait here.					As Good As It Gets 
SALESMAN	 No?	MELVIN	 (pointing) That jacket and give me a tie.					As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 No, it's all right. I'll just watch.	CAROL	 (mouthing the words to Melvin) My drink is following me.	CAROL	 You look s...	CAROL	 You look great.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.	CAROL	 (rising) And?	MELVIN	 No... (and before she can digest that) ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.	ON CAROL		As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 (rising) And?	MELVIN	 No... (and before she can digest that) ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.	ON CAROL		MELVIN	 No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.	MELVIN	 (really pissed, mutters) That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.	CAROL	 That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.	MELVIN	 Okay.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Okay.	CAROL	 (sitting) And mean it...	MELVIN	 Can we order first?	MELVIN	 (calling) Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. (to Carol) Baked or fries?	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Fries.	MELVIN	 (calling) One baked -- one fries.	STARTLED WAITER	 (shouting back) I'll tell your waiter.	MELVIN	 (to Carol) Okay, I got a real great compliment for you and it's true.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 (calling) One baked -- one fries.	STARTLED WAITER	 (shouting back) I'll tell your waiter.	MELVIN	 (to Carol) Okay, I got a real great compliment for you and it's true.	CAROL	 I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...	As Good As It Gets 
STARTLED WAITER	 (shouting back) I'll tell your waiter.	MELVIN	 (to Carol) Okay, I got a real great compliment for you and it's true.	CAROL	 I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...	MELVIN	 Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. (this is hell for him) I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...	MELVIN	 Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. (this is hell for him) I have this -- what?

The next morning I started taking these pills.	CAROL	 (a little confused) I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.	MELVIN	 You make me want to be a better man.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. (this is hell for him) I have this -- what? Ailment...

CAROL	 That's maybe the best compliment of my life.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.	MELVIN	 Takes months to know... They work little by little. (holds his head; then) Talking like this is exhausting.	CAROL	 Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?	MELVIN	 Never.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."	MELVIN	 (dissembling) There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...	CAROL	 (humiliated) Sex with Simon?	MELVIN	 It's one idea...	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 (dissembling) There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...	CAROL	 (humiliated) Sex with Simon?	MELVIN	 It's one idea...	CAROL	 That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.	CAROL	 (wiping away tears) I'll never forget you said it.	MELVIN	 It was a mistake.			As Good As It Gets 
PARENTS' VOICE	 (humorless male voice) Hi. This is Fred Bishop... (perky woman's voice) ... and Betty. (Fred again) We are sorry to be unable to take your call right now. Please leave a message and we'd appreciate your including the time/date and purpose of your call. (Simon mouths the word "date," then Betty speaks before the beep Bye-bye.	SIMON	 Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in town... (he waits) ... and, folks, you haven't come home later than 10 in your lives. Please pick up -- really... Okay... I'm going to call again in the morning. I need to see you. Or, at least get you to answer the phone.					As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 I don't think so. You need help with the pants?	SIMON	 (emphatically) No!!!	CAROL	 I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.	SIMON	 Uh-huh...	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.	SIMON	 (turning off the light) Good night.	CAROL	 Good night.	SIMON'S POV		As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 (a whisper) Hold it.	ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK		SIMON	 I've got to sketch you.			As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.	SIMON	 I just love her. (beat) How're you doing?					As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 (to Frank over the phone) Aww Jesus! No choice.	CAROL	 I got a gift for you.	MELVIN	 (on phone) Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.			As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 I got a gift for you.	MELVIN	 (on phone) Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.	CAROL	 (to Simon) Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!	MELVIN	 Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 (on phone) Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.	CAROL	 (to Simon) Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!	MELVIN	 Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.	MELVIN	 Good-bye. (to Simon) Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.	CAROL	 (hefting bag) I'll take a bus.	MELVIN	 I'll take you... why not?	CAROL	 I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. (turning to Simon) You have my number.	As Good As It Gets 
MELVIN	 I'll take you... why not?	CAROL	 I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. (turning to Simon) You have my number.	SIMON	 (hugging her) I love you... (sotto) Let him take you home.	CAROL	 Don't want to. I love you.	As Good As It Gets

SIMON	 (hugging her) I love you... (sotto) Let him take you home.	CAROL	 Don't want to. I love you.	MELVIN	 Don't say anything.	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 Sorry... You're fun to mess with.	MELVIN	 They took your place furnished. Jackie said she grabbed your personal stuff -- they were supposed to set you up here. (leading the way) There's this extra room -- I never use. It gets good light. No other answer really.					As Good As It Gets 
ON SIMON		SIMON	 (into phone) Hello. It's me. He took me in. Did you know? Hold on, I'll get him for you.					As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 Yeah... Well...	MELVIN	 (very concerned) How you doing?	CAROL	 I can trust my brain.	MELVIN	 That seems like a good choice.	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.	MELVIN	 (what the hell) Cute.	CAROL	 You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?	CAROL	 It's really something that you're looking after Simon. And what I said on the street. That was a bad thing to say. And it made me sick to my stomach. It was a bad thing to say. And I'd be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed your company... but the truth is you do bother me enormously and I know -- think -- that it's best for me to not have contact with you because you're just not ready and you're a pretty old guy to not be ready... and I'm too old to ignore that. But there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place. So thanks for the trips...	As Good As It Gets 
SIMON	 What did she say?	MELVIN	 I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"... (before Simon can celebrate) ... and she doesn't want contact with me. (a beat) I'm dying here.	SIMON	 Because... (gently) ... you love her?	MELVIN	 (sharply) No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.	As Good As It Gets

She's evicted me from my life.	SIMON	 Did you like it that much?	MELVIN	 (furiously) It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.	As Good As It Gets

MELVIN	 What a break...	CAROL	 (losing it a bit) Is it a secret what you're doing here?	MELVIN	 I had to see you...	CAROL	 Because...	As Good As It Gets 
ANOTHER ANGLE		MELVIN	 (serious) Wait a minute, I'm overstating here, maybe the inside stairs. I don't want to sit with my feet in the gutter. What does that serve? It only...	CAROL	 Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...	BEVERLY	 (butting in) Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...

MELVIN	 I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.	CAROL	 Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well... (as he scoffs) I'm not the answer for you.	MELVIN	 Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.	CAROL	 You know what? I...	As Good As It Gets 
CAROL	 You know what? I...	MELVIN	 Just let me talk. (gathers himself with uncertainty, then:) I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence... (he has reached her) ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...	ON CAROL		MELVIN	 I think most people miss that about you and I watch wondering how they can watch you bring them food and clear their dishes and never get that they have just met the greatest woman alive... And the fact that I get it makes me feel great... about me! (a real question filled with concern for her) You got a real good reason to walk out on that?	As Good As It Gets
